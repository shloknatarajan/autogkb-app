    "title": "The effect of gene polymorphism on ticagrelor metabolism: an in vitro study of 22 CYP3A4 variants in Chinese Han population",
    "pmcid": "PMC11430164",
    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of 22 CYP3A4 gene polymorphisms on the metabolism of ticagrelor, an oral antiplatelet medication. Using insect cells to express these variants, the research examines their effects on the conversion of ticagrelor to its active metabolite, AR-C124910XX. Key findings reveal significant variability in metabolic efficiency among different CYP3A4 variants. Notably, variants CYP3A4*11, *18, and *33 demonstrated significantly higher metabolic clearance compared to the wild-type, while 14 other variants showed reduced metabolic activity. CYP3A4*30 was found to have minimal to no activity. These results suggest that genetic differences in CYP3A4 can lead to variations in ticagrelor metabolism and potential adverse effects in patients, highlighting the necessity for personalized medicine approaches in antiplatelet therapy.",
