    "pmcid": "PMC6435416",
    "summary": "This study investigated the relationship between CYP2D6 metabolizer status and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) associated with risperidone treatment in children and adolescents. Researchers analyzed data from 257 children aged 18 and under, comparing those classified as poor/intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers to those with normal/ultrarapid enzyme activity. Results showed that AEs were significantly more common in the poor/intermediate group (46%) compared to the normal/ultrarapid group (27%), indicating a 2.4-fold increase in the risk of AEs for children with the poor/intermediate metabolizer genotype. The study suggests the potential utility of pharmacogenetic testing prior to prescribing risperidone to better manage risks associated with treatment.",
