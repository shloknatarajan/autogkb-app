    "pmcid": "PMC3584248",
    "summary": "This exploratory study evaluated the relationship between CYP2D6 genetic variants, endoxifen plasma concentrations, and disease recurrence in 224 Filipino and Vietnamese women undergoing tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer. Results showed that reduced endoxifen levels corresponded with functionally important CYP2D6 genotypes, while unexpectedly, high endoxifen concentrations (>70 ng/ml) were associated with a greater risk of recurrence. Notably, 25% of recurrences occurred in patients with these high endoxifen levels. The findings suggest an optimal concentration range for endoxifen in therapeutic contexts.",
