    "title": "Comprehensive Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacogenetic Evaluation of Once-Daily Efavirenz 400 and 600 mg in Treatment-Naïve HIV-Infected Patients at 96 Weeks: Results of the ENCORE1 Study",
    "pmcid": "PMC4916189",
    "summary": "The ENCORE1 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of once-daily efavirenz at doses of 400 mg versus 600 mg over a period of 96 weeks in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients. The study confirmed the non-inferiority of the lower dose (EFV400) in terms of virological efficacy, with pVL <200 copies/mL at week 96 being 97% for EFV400 compared to 99% for EFV600 (p = 0.091). Key pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly correlated with viral load suppression, and the increased rate of adverse events associated with EFV600 did not correlate with the polymorphisms assessed including CYP2B6 and ABCB1. Lower concentrations of EFV were observed in patients experiencing fewer central nervous system-related adverse effects. The findings suggest that reducing the efavirenz dose to 400 mg may enhance tolerance while maintaining effective viral control. The study also questions the validity of the previously recommended minimum effective concentration of EFV.",
