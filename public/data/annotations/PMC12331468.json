    "pmcid": "PMC12331468",
    "summary": "This study identifies genetic variants in the TYMS, DPYD, and GSTP1 genes among others, which influence the response to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in Chilean patients with advanced colorectal cancer. A total of 82 patients were analyzed, revealing significant associations between specific genotypes and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Noteworthy findings include that the G allele of GSTP1 was protective against neuropathy but increased mucositis risk, while the deletion genotype of TYMS offered protection against hematological adverse reactions. The study develops predictive models for anemia and pain, emphasizing the potential for personalized medicine in optimizing chemotherapy safety.",
