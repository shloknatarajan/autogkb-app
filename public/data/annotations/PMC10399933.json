    "pmcid": "PMC10399933",
    "summary": "This study investigates the influence of genetic variants in SLCO1B1, ABCG2, and CYP2C9 on statin intolerance in 2042 patients starting statin therapy using data from the Helsinki Biobank. The results confirm that the SLCO1B1 c.521C/C genotype is associated with simvastatin intolerance (HR 1.88), and also shows a significant association with pravastatin intolerance (HR 2.11). No significant associations were found for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. These findings suggest potential pharmacogenetic considerations for statin prescribing, indicating that SLCO1B1 variants may inform clinical decisions in managing statin therapy. The methodology demonstrates feasibility for further research in larger cohorts.",
