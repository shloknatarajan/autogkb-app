            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype on thiopurine dose intensity, myelosuppression, and treatment outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) within the UK ALL97 trial. The trial compared the effects of mercaptopurine versus thioguanine and prednisone versus dexamethasone in children aged 1 to 18 years, with TPMT genotyping performed to assess its influence on treatment. Results indicated that TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had better event-free survival (EFS) compared to TPMT wild-type patients, and while TPMT heterozygotes experienced more cytopenias, these did not negatively impact treatment outcomes.",
