        "summary": "This study investigated the impact of TPMT genotype on thiopurine dose intensity, myelosuppression, and treatment outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The study found that TPMT heterozygotes required more frequent dose adjustments due to cytopenias but had better event-free survival (EFS) compared to wild-type patients. The study concluded that thiopurine-induced cytopenias did not negatively affect treatment outcomes.",
