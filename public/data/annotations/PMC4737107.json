            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype on thiopurine dose intensity, myelosuppression, and treatment outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) within the UK ALL97 trial. The trial involved a randomized comparison of dexamethasone versus prednisone and mercaptopurine versus thioguanine, with TPMT genotyping conducted to assess its influence on treatment. Results indicated that TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had better event-free survival (EFS) compared to TPMT wild-type patients, while TPMT*1/*3C patients had poorer outcomes, potentially due to non-compliance, and thiopurine-induced cytopenias did not adversely affect treatment outcomes.",
