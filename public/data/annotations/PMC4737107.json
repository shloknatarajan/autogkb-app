The study did not specify any pre-existing conditions for the participants, but it did mention that none of the TPMT*1/*3C children had CNS disease at diagnosis or Down syndrome, although two had T-cell immunophenotype. Gender distribution was not explicitly detailed for the entire cohort, but it was noted that girls experienced more myelosuppression than boys. The study also included a subset of patients for dosing analysis, with 1082 participants, and it was noted that there was no significant difference in clinical characteristics such as gender, age, WBC count at diagnosis, steroid randomization, or thiopurine randomization between patients with and without thiopurine data.

The study population consisted of children aged 1 to 18 years who were part of the ALL97 trial, which was a randomized comparison of dexamethasone versus prednisone and mercaptopurine versus thioguanine. The trial included an add-on thiopurine biological study, and the cohort was previously described in related publications. The study analyzed data from 1334 patients, with TPMT genotype data available for 69% of the participants. The trial was conducted with local ethics committee approval, and informed consent was obtained from patients and/or their parents. The trial was modified in November 1999 to ALL97/99, retaining the randomizations and biological studies. The study focused on patients who achieved remission by the end of induction and had completed at least 95% of maintenance treatment from Week 8. High-risk patients and those who relapsed or died during the first year of chemotherapy were excluded from the thiopurine dosage analysis. The study involved detailed recording of drug dosages and cell counts, with TPMT genotype determined from blood samples.

The study highlighted that TPMT*1/*3C patients had a significantly worse survival outcome, with a hazard ratio of 3.2 (95% CI: 1.5\u20136.8, P = 0.003) compared to TPMT*1/*1 patients. Poor compliance with oral chemotherapy was associated with worse EFS (P = 0.02), and non-compliance may have contributed to the poorer outcomes for TPMT*1/*3C patients. The study also noted that patients on escalated doses had worse EFS (P = 0.04), but there was no significant difference in EFS by dose intensity or duration of cytopenias. Unlike some other trials, TPMT heterozygosity was not linked to a higher rate of second cancers.
