            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype on thiopurine dose intensity, myelosuppression, and treatment outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) within the UK ALL97 trial. The researchers analyzed the relationship between TPMT genetic variants and treatment responses, focusing on event-free survival (EFS) and the occurrence of cytopenias. The results indicated that TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had better EFS compared to TPMT wild-type patients, and while TPMT heterozygotes experienced more frequent cytopenias, these did not negatively affect treatment outcomes.",

Outcome analysis was of event\u2010free survival (EFS), with an event defined as time to relapse or death, as used in previous ALL97 analysis (Vora *et al*et al, [2006](#bjh13240-bib-0042)2006). Kaplan\u2010Meier curves were calculated and comparisons between groups were performed by the log\u2010rank statistic with stratification by age, gender, white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis, trial phase (ALL97 or ALL97/99) and steroid received (prednisone, dexamethasone). Overall EFS (from randomization at the start of treatment) was carried out for any analysis involving all patients. For the outcome analysis of dosing and cell count data, patients joined the analysis at the end of year one (i.e., patients with events in year 1 were excluded) and EFS was calculated from this starting point (termed jEFS), stratified by length of maintenance (two or three years). All *P*P values are two\u2010sided, a *P*P value <0\u00b705 was considered statistically significant. Cox regression multivariate analysis was used to test whether the effects of variables were independent. Analyses were to the annual follow up of 30th April 2011; median follow\u2010up for survivors 11\u00b73 years (range 9\u00b76 to 14\u00b73 years).
