    "pmcid": "PMC2859392",
    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 genetic polymorphisms on plasma levels of efavirenz and nevirapine in Thai adults co-infected with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) receiving rifampicin. In a cohort of 124 patients, those with the CYP2B6-TT genotype had significantly higher plasma concentrations of efavirenz and a trend towards higher levels of nevirapine compared to GT and GG genotypes. Rifampicin co-administration had minimal effects on drug levels. The study highlights the importance of genetic factors in drug metabolism among this patient population, advocating for pharmacogenomic considerations in antiretroviral therapy.",
