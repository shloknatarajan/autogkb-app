    "pmcid": "PMC11971672",
    "summary": "This nonrandomized clinical trial involving 2925 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with clopidogrel found that those carrying the loss-of-function (LOF) allele of the *CYP2C19* gene had a higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared to noncarriers (2.7% vs 1.6%, p=0.048). However, there were no significant differences regarding major bleeding or all-cause mortality between the two groups. The study indicates that clopidogrel's effectiveness may be reduced in patients with *CYP2C19* LOF alleles, emphasizing the importance of considering genetic testing for personalized antiplatelet therapy in this population.",
