    "pmcid": "PMC8973308",
    "summary": "This study investigated the correlation between genetic variants in the *NUDT15* and *TPMT* genes and side effects in Colombian pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing maintenance therapy. Conducted at a tertiary care hospital, it included 70 patients. Genetic analyses revealed 4 heterozygous patients for *NUDT15* and varying frequencies for *TPMT* variants, but no statistically significant associations were found between these genetic variants and observed toxicities. The authors concluded that larger studies are necessary to better understand these associations, highlighting the need for more focused research in Colombia's genetically diverse population.",
