    "pmcid": "PMC11603346",
    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the associations between CYP2B6 polymorphisms and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in HIV patients. The study identified a significant increased risk of efavirenz (EFV)-induced liver injury associated with CYP2B6 polymorphisms (*CYP2B6*6, *CYP2B6*1/*1, and *CYP2B6*1/*6), whereas the same polymorphisms were linked to a reduced risk of nevirapine (NVP)-induced liver injury. A total of 39 publications were included, with the findings suggesting CYP2B6 genetic variants could serve as biomarkers for predicting ARVDILI risk in HIV patients undergoing treatment with EFV or NVP. The study emphasizes the need for personalized medicine approaches in managing HIV treatment to minimize serious adverse effects.",
