    "pmcid": "PMC3113609",
    "summary": "This study investigates the association between the HLA-A★3101 allele and hypersensitivity reactions induced by carbamazepine in individuals of European descent. It identifies HLA-A★3101 as a significant genetic risk factor for multiple forms of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity, including the hypersensitivity syndrome, maculopapular exanthema, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS-TEN). The allele's presence was associated with increased risk, shifting the probability of hypersensitivity from approximately 5% to 26%. This finding highlights the importance of genetic testing for HLA-A★3101 in predicting carbamazepine hypersensitivity reactions among European populations.",
