    "title": "A Novel Admixture-Based Pharmacogenetic Approach to Refine Warfarin Dosing in Caribbean Hispanics",
    "pmcid": "PMC4706412",
    "summary": "This study develops an admixture-adjusted pharmacogenomic approach to refine warfarin dosing specifically for Caribbean Hispanic patients. Utilizing multiple linear regression analysis of 255 patients, the algorithm incorporates genetic markers, admixture, and clinical factors, resulting in improved predictability of warfarin doses compared to traditional clinical models. The new model demonstrated a higher predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.70) and a lower mean absolute error (MAE = 0.72 mg/day) and resulted in ideal dose predictions for 45.5% of high-risk patients, compared to just 29% for the clinical algorithm. The findings suggest that incorporating genetic and admixture information enhances warfarin dosing precision in this genetically diverse population.",
