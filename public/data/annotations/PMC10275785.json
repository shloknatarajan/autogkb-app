    "title": "Effect of NLRP3 inflammasome genes polymorphism on disease susceptibility and response to TNF-α inhibitors in Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis",
    "pmcid": "PMC10275785",
    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of polymorphisms in the NLRP3 and CARD8 genes on disease susceptibility and response to TNF-α inhibitors in Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In a cohort of 100 RA patients and 100 healthy controls, the analysis revealed no significant differences in genotype distributions of the CARD8 (rs2043211) and NLRP3 (rs4612666) SNPs between the two groups. However, increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) correlated with higher disease activity scores (DAS-28). Notably, variant genotypes of CARD8 and NLRP3 were associated with a poorer response to anti-TNF-α therapy and higher disease activity. This suggests a potential role of these polymorphisms in influencing RA disease course and treatment outcomes.",
