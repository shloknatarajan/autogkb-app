            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the association between specific HLA alleles and lamotrigine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) in the Thai population, motivated by the need to identify genetic markers that could predict these adverse reactions. A case-control design was employed, involving 15 patients with lamotrigine-induced CADR and 50 lamotrigine-tolerant controls, with HLA-A and HLA-B genotyping performed using PCR-SSO. The results revealed significant associations of HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-B*15:02 alleles with lamotrigine-induced CADR, suggesting these alleles as potential screening markers to prevent CADR in Thai patients.",
