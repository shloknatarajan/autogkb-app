        "summary": "This study investigates the association between specific HLA alleles and lamotrigine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) in the Thai population. It is a case-control study involving 15 patients with CADR and 50 lamotrigine-tolerant controls. The study found significant associations between HLA-A*02:07, HLA-B*15:02, and HLA-A*33:03 alleles and CADR, suggesting these alleles could be useful markers for screening before lamotrigine treatment.",
