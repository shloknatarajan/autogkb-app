            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the association between specific HLA alleles and lamotrigine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) in the Thai population, motivated by the need to identify genetic markers that could predict such adverse reactions. A case-control design was employed, involving 15 patients with lamotrigine-induced CADR and 50 lamotrigine-tolerant controls, with HLA-A and HLA-B genotyping performed using PCR-SSO techniques. The results revealed significant associations of HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-B*15:02 with lamotrigine-induced CADR, and HLA-A*33:03, HLA-B*15:02, and HLA-B*44:03 with lamotrigine-induced maculopapular exanthema (MPE), suggesting these alleles could serve as potential screening markers in the Thai population.",
