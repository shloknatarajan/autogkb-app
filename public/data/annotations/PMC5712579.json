            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the association between specific HLA alleles and lamotrigine-induced cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) in the Thai population. It was a case-control study involving 15 patients with lamotrigine-induced CADR and 50 lamotrigine-tolerant controls, where HLA-A and HLA-B genotyping was performed. The results identified significant associations of HLA-A*02:07 and HLA-B*15:02 with lamotrigine-induced CADR, and HLA-A*33:03, HLA-B*15:02, and HLA-B*44:03 with lamotrigine-induced maculopapular exanthema (MPE), suggesting these alleles could serve as potential screening markers for preventing CADR in Thai patients.",
