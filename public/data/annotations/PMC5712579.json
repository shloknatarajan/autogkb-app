The mean age of the CADR patients was 35.2 years with a standard deviation of 22.1 years, and 73.3% of them were female. The median dosage of lamotrigine for these patients was 50 mg per day. There were no significant differences in gender, age, dosage of lamotrigine, or concomitant use of valproic acid between the CADR patients and the tolerant controls. The tolerant group had a mean age of 38.2 years with a standard deviation of 19.0 years, and 76.0% were female. Both groups were recruited from various hospitals in Thailand, and all participants were of Thai ethnicity. The study did not specify any pre-existing conditions beyond the indication for lamotrigine use, which included epilepsy, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder, and major depressive disorder.",
