    "title": "The impact of non-genetic and genetic factors on a stable warfarin dose in Thai patients",
    "pmcid": "PMC5508045",
    "summary": "This study aimed to explore the influences of both genetic and non-genetic factors on the variability of stable warfarin doses among 250 Thai patients. Results indicated that genetic polymorphisms in VKORC1 (-1639G > A) and CYP2C9*3 significantly impacted warfarin dosing, with variant carriers needing lower doses. In contrast, neither CYP4F2 rs2108622 nor UGT1A1 rs887829 showed significant effects on dosing. Overall, 51.3% of dose variability was explained by a combination of genetic factors and non-genetic factors, such as age and body mass index.",
