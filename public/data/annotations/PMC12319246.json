    "pmcid": "PMC12319246",
    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of pharmacogenetic variability on long-term clinical outcomes in kidney transplant recipients over a 12-year follow-up. A total of 79 patients were analyzed for 37 SNPs in 14 genes involved in drug metabolism and transport. The results showed associations between certain gene variants (CYP3A5, CYP2B6, ABCB1, and ABCC2) and clinical outcomes including patient survival, renal function, tumor occurrence, and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. The findings underscore the importance of pharmacogenetic testing for personalizing immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplantation, highlighting that specific variants can influence survival rates, renal function recovery, and the risks of nephrotoxicity and tumors.",
