    "summary": "This prospective, opportunistic steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) study evaluated how pregnancy alters exposure to bupropion (BUP) and its active metabolites and whether common functional variants in CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 modify BUP disposition during pregnancy.\n\nStudy design and methods:\n- Pregnant women (n=28) taking clinically prescribed bupropion for depression underwent intensive plasma sampling and urine collection at steady state during early (10–14 weeks), mid (22–26 weeks), and/or late pregnancy (34–38 weeks), with postpartum sampling when available.\n- Quantified analytes: BUP and the active metabolites hydroxybupropion (OHBUP; primarily CYP2B6-mediated), threohydrobupropion (TB), and erythrohydrobupropion (EB), plus urinary glucuronide conjugates.\n- Genotyping: CYP2B6 alleles including *6 (reduced function) and CYP2C19 *2/*3 (loss-of-function) and *17 (gain-of-function). Analyses focused on paired within-subject pregnancy vs postpartum comparisons where possible and genotype–PK associations in mid/late pregnancy.\n\nKey pregnancy effects on PK:\n- Maternal BUP exposure showed a modest trend toward reduction in late pregnancy compared with postpartum (lower BUP AUCss; not statistically significant), consistent with pregnancy-related physiologic changes (e.g., altered enzyme activity and renal handling).\n- Despite expectations of increased CYP2B6 activity in pregnancy, OHBUP exposure (AUCss) and the OHBUP/BUP metabolic ratio were broadly similar in pregnancy vs postpartum. The authors interpret this as increased OHBUP formation being offset by increased OHBUP clearance, particularly via glucuronidation and renal elimination.\n- Urinary data supported enhanced conjugative clearance in pregnancy: the fraction of dose excreted as OHBUP-glucuronide and TB-glucuronide was higher in late pregnancy than postpartum, consistent with pregnancy-associated upregulation of UGT pathways.\n\nPharmacogenomic findings:\n- CYP2B6*6: In mid-pregnancy, carriers showed a lower OHBUP/BUP metabolic ratio and a trend toward higher BUP AUCss (directionally consistent with reduced CYP2B6 function), but effects were not robust across gestation and were not clearly evident in late pregnancy—likely limited by sample size and variability.\n- CYP2C19 phenotype: Poor/intermediate metabolizers (driven mainly by *2) had higher TB/BUP and EB/BUP metabolic ratios in both mid- and late pregnancy, and higher TB (and a trend for higher EB) exposure in late pregnancy. This aligns with CYP2C19’s contribution to downstream hydroxylation/clearance of TB and EB.\n- Overall, pregnancy did not appear to fundamentally change the expected direction of genotype–phenotype relationships: predicted CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 metabolic phenotypes in pregnancy were similar to those in nonpregnant adults.\n\nClinical interpretation:\n- Pregnancy may slightly lower maternal exposure to parent bupropion, but exposure to OHBUP—the major active metabolite thought to drive much of bupropion’s smoking-cessation pharmacology—appears largely maintained during pregnancy, potentially due to counterbalancing changes in formation and clearance.\n- CYP2C19 reduced-function status may increase exposure to TB/EB during pregnancy, which could be relevant for drug–drug interactions (TB/EB can inhibit CYP2D6), though clinical outcome implications were not tested.\n\nLimitations noted by authors:\n- Small sample sizes for paired comparisons and genotype strata, heterogeneous formulations/doses (though some analyses restricted to 150 mg BID), and limited early-pregnancy power.\n- Plasma conjugated metabolites were not measured; urine-based conjugation estimates may be affected by carryover from prior doses.\n\nBottom line:\nPregnancy produces only modest changes in bupropion steady-state PK, with a possible slight decrease in parent-drug exposure but preserved OHBUP exposure, likely due to increased OHBUP glucuronidation and elimination. CYP2C19 loss-of-function variants increase TB/EB relative exposure during pregnancy, while CYP2B6*6 shows expected but inconsistent effects on hydroxylation metrics in this small cohort.",
