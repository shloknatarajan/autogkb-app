  "summary": "This prospective, opportunistic steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) study evaluated how pregnancy and common functional variants in CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 influence exposure to bupropion (BUP) and its active metabolites. Twenty-eight pregnant women taking therapeutic BUP for depression underwent intensive plasma and urine sampling at defined gestational windows (early, mid, late) and, when available, postpartum. BUP, hydroxybupropion (OHBUP), threohydrobupropion (TB), and erythrohydrobupropion (EB) were quantified by LC\u2013MS/MS; urine was additionally assessed for glucuronide conjugates. Genotyping covered multiple CYP2B6 alleles (including *6) and CYP2C19 *2/*3/*17 to infer metabolizer phenotypes.\n\nAcross paired comparisons (mid vs late pregnancy; late pregnancy vs postpartum), maternal BUP exposure showed at most a modest reduction in late pregnancy relative to postpartum (lower AUCss trend), without a statistically significant change in apparent oral clearance. Despite the expectation of pregnancy-induced CYP2B6 induction, OHBUP exposure (AUCss) and the OHBUP/BUP AUC ratio were largely unchanged versus postpartum, suggesting that increased formation may be offset by enhanced downstream clearance. Urine data supported increased conjugation in pregnancy: a higher fraction of dose was recovered as OHBUP-glucuronide and TB-glucuronide in late pregnancy compared with postpartum, consistent with pregnancy-associated upregulation of UGT-mediated glucuronidation and/or enhanced renal elimination. Creatinine clearance was higher in pregnancy than postpartum, reflecting increased glomerular filtration during gestation.\n\nPharmacogenomic analyses indicated that genotype effects in pregnancy generally mirrored those known in nonpregnant adults. CYP2B6*6 carriers showed a directionally lower OHBUP/BUP metabolic ratio (consistent with reduced hydroxylation capacity) and trends toward higher parent-drug exposure in mid-pregnancy, but effects were not robust across gestational windows, likely limited by sample size. CYP2C19 poor/intermediate metabolizers had higher TB/BUP and EB/BUP ratios (and higher TB/EB exposure in late pregnancy), consistent with CYP2C19\u2019s contribution to further metabolism of reduced metabolites; however, CYP2C19 phenotype did not materially change BUP exposure.\n\nOverall, the study concludes that pregnancy may slightly lower maternal exposure to bupropion, while exposure to the key active metabolite OHBUP remains similar to the nonpregnant/postpartum state\u2014potentially due to increased OHBUP glucuronidation and elimination during pregnancy. The clinical implication is that pregnancy-related physiologic changes and CYP2B6/CYP2C19 genetic variation can shift metabolic pathways, but do not appear to substantially reduce OHBUP exposure at steady state; whether these PK patterns translate to altered smoking-cessation efficacy in pregnancy remains untested.",
