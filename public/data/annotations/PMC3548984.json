    "title": "CYP2D6 Metabolism and Patient Outcome in the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group Trial (ABCSG) 8",
    "pmcid": "PMC3548984",
    "summary": "The article assesses the impact of CYP2D6 genotypes on the efficacy of tamoxifen in treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer within the ABCSG Trial 8. It discusses how variations in CYP2D6 metabolism significantly influenced disease recurrence risks during tamoxifen therapy (5 years), with poor metabolizers (PM) showing higher odds of adverse events compared to extensive metabolizers (EM). Notably, once patients switched to anastrozole, the detrimental effects associated with poor CYP2D6 metabolism were no longer observed, indicating that anastrozole treatment may mitigate these risks. The study highlights that CYP2D6 genetic profiling may be necessary to optimize tamoxifen therapy outcomes without factoring in future transitions to more effective treatments like anastrozole.",
