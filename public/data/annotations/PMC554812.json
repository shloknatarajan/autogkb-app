    "pmcid": "PMC554812",
    "summary": "The study investigates the relationship between the HLA-B*5801 allele and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) from allopurinol, a common medication for gout. Researchers conducted a case-control study with 51 patients experiencing allopurinol-SCAR and 228 controls. They found that 100% of SCAR patients carried the HLA-B*5801 allele, compared to only 15% in allopurinol-tolerant patients and 20% in a healthy control group. This allele was associated with significantly increased risk for severe reactions, particularly in the Han Chinese population, indicating a strong genetic predisposition to drug hypersensitivity linked to allopurinol.",
