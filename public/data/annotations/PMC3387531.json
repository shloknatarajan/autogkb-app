    "title": "Toxicogenomics of nevirapine-associated cutaneous and hepatic adverse events among populations of African, Asian, and European descent",
    "pmcid": "PMC3387531",
    "summary": "This study examines the associations between genetic variants and nevirapine-induced adverse events in HIV-infected individuals. It identifies genetic polymorphisms linked to severe cutaneous (e.g., rash) and hepatic (e.g., liver damage) adverse reactions. The retrospective case-control design involved 276 cases and 587 controls, focusing on variants in the CYP2B6 and HLA genes. Results revealed that cutaneous adverse events are linked to the CYP2B6 516G→T variant and specific HLA alleles (HLA-Cw*04 and HLA-B*35), primarily in Black and Asian populations, while hepatic events were associated with HLA-DRB1*01 among Whites. The study highlights significant race-related differences and suggests distinct underlying mechanisms of toxicity, noting that genetic testing for these variants might not be sensitive enough for routine clinical use.",
