    "title": "Impacts of Pharmacokinetic Gene Polymorphisms on Steady‐State Plasma Concentrations of Simvastatin in Thai Population",
    "pmcid": "PMC12038368",
    "summary": "This study investigates the influence of pharmacokinetic gene polymorphisms on the plasma concentrations of simvastatin in a Thai population comprising 89 patients with dyslipidemia or coronary artery disease. The focus is on variations in the *SLCO1B1* gene, particularly the c.521T>C polymorphism, which is associated with higher steady-state levels of simvastatin acid and an increased risk of myotoxicity. Genotyping revealed that patients with the SLCO1B1 c.521TC+CC genotype had significantly higher plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid (0.53 ng/mL) compared to those with the c.521TT genotype (0.19 ng/mL). The findings support the potential clinical utility of *SLCO1B1* genotyping in personalizing simvastatin therapy to mitigate adverse effects in the Thai population.",
