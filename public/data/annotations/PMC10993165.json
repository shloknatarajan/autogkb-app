    "pmcid": "PMC10993165",
    "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) induced by sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and cotrimoxazole (CTX). Analyzing data from six studies involving 322 patients, it found significant associations between multiple HLA alleles and SCARs. Specifically, the study reported that the HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-B*38:02, and HLA-C*08:01 genotypes were correlated with SMX/CTX-induced SCARs, particularly Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). The findings highlight the importance of HLA screening in predicting hypersensitivity to SMX and CTX, which may help in clinical practice to identify at-risk individuals.",
