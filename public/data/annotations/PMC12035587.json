    "title": "Severe myelosuppression and alopecia after thiopurine initiation in a patient with NUDT15 deficiency",
    "pmcid": "PMC12035587",
    "summary": "This article presents a clinical case of a 41-year-old South Asian female who developed severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and alopecia after initiating thiopurine therapy due to her homozygous *NUDT15* gene mutations. Thiopurines are commonly used immunosuppressants but can cause significant adverse effects, especially in patients with genetic predispositions affecting drug metabolism. Genetic testing revealed her homozygous loss-of-function alleles in the *NUDT15* gene, highlighting the importance of pharmacogenetic evaluations prior to thiopurine treatment. The case emphasizes the need for revised clinical guidelines that incorporate *NUDT15* screening, particularly given the racial disparities in mutation prevalence that affect thiopurine tolerance.",
