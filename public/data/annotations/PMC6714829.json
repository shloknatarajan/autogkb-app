    "pmcid": "PMC6714829",
    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of the SLCO1B1 gene polymorphisms (388A>G and 521T>C) on hepatic function, lipid levels, and response to simvastatin in 542 Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia. Results indicate that carriers of the 388AA genotype had significantly higher ALT and AST levels compared to AG and GG carriers, as well as significantly higher HDL-C levels. The 388A/521T haplotype was more frequent in patients with abnormal ALT and AST levels. Furthermore, those with the 388G allele and 521TT genotype showed improved lipid-lowering responses to simvastatin after 4 weeks of treatment, suggesting genetic variants can influence the effectiveness of simvastatin therapy.",
