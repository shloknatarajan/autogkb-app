    "pmcid": "PMC12036300",
    "summary": "This study explores the prevalence of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms, particularly *CYP2C19*2, *CYP2C19*3, and *CYP2C19*17, among Syrian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and receiving a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel. In a sample of 50 patients, allele frequencies were found to be 8% for *CYP2C19*2, 0% for *CYP2C19*3, and 17% for *CYP2C19*17. The study revealed no significant association between these polymorphisms and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) or bleeding complications. Notably, although the presence of *CYP2C19*2 did not correlate with increased risk of ischemic events, clinicians may consider higher doses of clopidogrel for those heterozygous for *CYP2C19*2 to optimize individual responses. The authors conclude that genetic testing may inform clopidogrel therapy, though recommend further studies with larger sample sizes to validate findings and enhance understanding of genetic influences on drug efficacy.",
