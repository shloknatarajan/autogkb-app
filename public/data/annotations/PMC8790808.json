    "pmcid": "PMC8790808",
    "summary": "This study identifies associations between specific HLA alleles and the risk of hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase in pediatric leukemia patients across diverse racial cohorts. Using genome-wide association and HLA allele studies, the research revealed that alleles such as HLA-DQB1*02:02 and HLA-DRB1*07:01 are significantly linked to hypersensitivity, particularly in patients of European ancestry. Notably, this haplotype is also connected to reactions from non-PEGylated asparaginase. Furthermore, in non-European ancestry groups, the variant rs9958628 in the ARHGAP28 gene reached genome-wide significance for hypersensitivity risk. This research underscores the importance of genetic factors in adverse drug reactions across different ancestries.",
