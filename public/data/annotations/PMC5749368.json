            "content": "The study aimed to determine if genetic variants could identify patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) at increased risk of bleeding when treated with warfarin. Conducted as a subanalysis of the Hokusai VTE trial, it involved genotyping patients for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants to classify them into warfarin sensitivity types. The results showed that sensitive and highly sensitive responders, as defined by their genotypes, had a higher risk of bleeding, spent more time overanticoagulated, and required lower warfarin doses compared to normal responders, highlighting the potential of genetic testing in managing warfarin therapy.",
            "citations": [

                "The results of this analysis extend the results of the previous ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 pharmacogenetic analysis to demonstrate that patients with VTE who have a sensitive or highly sensitive warfarin genotype spend more time overanticoagulated, require a lower warfarin dose and have higher bleeding rates with warfarin therapy.",
