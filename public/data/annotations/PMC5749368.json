Utilizing a subanalysis of the Hokusai VTE trial, patients were genotyped for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants and categorized into warfarin sensitivity types. The results showed that sensitive and highly sensitive responders, as defined by these genotypes, had an increased risk of bleeding, spent more time overanticoagulated, and required lower warfarin doses compared to normal responders.",
