The study also noted that sensitive and highly sensitive responders had a higher prevalence of Asian ancestry, which aligns with known differences in allele frequencies affecting warfarin sensitivity.

It was found that patients with certain genotypes in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes, which influence warfarin sensitivity, had different clinical outcomes. Among the 1978 patients randomized to warfarin, 63.0% were normal responders, 34.1% were sensitive responders, and 2.8% were highly sensitive responders. Sensitive and highly sensitive responders had heparin therapy discontinued earlier (p<0.001), required a lower final weekly warfarin dose (p<0.001), spent more time overanticoagulated (p<0.001), and had an increased bleeding risk compared to normal responders. Specifically, the hazard ratio (HR) for bleeding was 1.38 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.71, p=0.0035) for sensitive responders and 1.79 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.99, p=0.0252) for highly sensitive responders.
