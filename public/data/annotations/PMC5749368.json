            "content": "The study aimed to determine if genetic variants could identify patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) at increased risk of bleeding when treated with warfarin. Utilizing data from the Hokusai VTE trial, a randomized, double-blind study comparing edoxaban and warfarin, the researchers genotyped patients for CYP2C9 and VKORC1 variants to classify them into warfarin sensitivity groups. The results showed that sensitive and highly sensitive responders, as defined by their genotypes, had a higher risk of bleeding, spent more time overanticoagulated, and required lower warfarin doses compared to normal responders, highlighting the potential utility of genetic testing in managing warfarin therapy.",
