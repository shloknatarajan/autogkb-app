            "content": "The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus gliclazide, both combined with metformin, in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and glucotoxicity. Conducted as a single-center, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial, it involved 129 participants who were treated for 12 weeks. The results demonstrated that sitagliptin combined with metformin was noninferior to gliclazide combined with metformin, with sitagliptin achieving faster glycemic targets, greater weight reductions, and similar safety profiles, while genetic polymorphisms significantly influenced drug efficacy, underscoring the importance of personalized medicine.",
