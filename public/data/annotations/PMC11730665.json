            "content": "This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus gliclazide, both combined with metformin, in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and glucotoxicity. Conducted as a single-center, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial, it involved 129 participants who received either sitagliptin or gliclazide for 4 weeks, followed by metformin monotherapy for 8 weeks. The results demonstrated that sitagliptin was noninferior to gliclazide in reducing glycated hemoglobin levels, with sitagliptin achieving faster glycemic targets and greater weight reductions, while genetic polymorphisms significantly influenced drug efficacy.",
