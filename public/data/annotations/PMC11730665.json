            "content": "The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus gliclazide, both combined with metformin, in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and glucotoxicity. Conducted as a single-center, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial, it involved 129 participants who received either sitagliptin or gliclazide for 4 weeks, followed by metformin monotherapy for 8 weeks. Results showed that sitagliptin was noninferior to gliclazide in reducing glycated hemoglobin levels, with sitagliptin achieving faster glycemic targets and greater weight reductions, while genetic polymorphisms significantly influenced drug efficacy.",
