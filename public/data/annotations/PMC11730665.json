        "summary": "This study compared the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus gliclazide, both combined with metformin, in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and glucotoxicity. It was a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial. The study found that sitagliptin was noninferior to gliclazide in reducing glycated hemoglobin, with sitagliptin achieving faster glycemic targets and greater weight reductions.",
