    "title": "Shared peptide binding of HLA Class I and II alleles associate with cutaneous nevirapine hypersensitivity and identify novel risk alleles",
    "pmcid": "PMC5561238",
    "summary": "The article explores how variations in HLA Class I and II alleles associate with cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions to the HIV-1 drug nevirapine (NVP). By analyzing the peptide binding properties of these HLA molecules, researchers discovered that specific HLA-C alleles, particularly HLA-C*04:01, significantly predispose individuals to cutaneous hypersensitivity across different ethnicities. Additionally, certain HLA-B alleles provide protective benefits against this hypersensitivity. The study advances understanding of the mechanisms behind drug hypersensitivity by revealing the impact of shared peptide binding grooves among varying HLA alleles, suggesting that these interactions may lead to adverse drug reactions.",
