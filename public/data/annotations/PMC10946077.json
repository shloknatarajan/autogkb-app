    "pmcid": "PMC10946077",
    "summary": "This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of irinotecan as a second-line treatment for gastric cancer (GC) based on patients' UGT1A1*6 gene polymorphisms. Involving 110 advanced GC patients, the research assigned irinotecan dosages according to UGT1A1 genotype: GG (125 mg/m2), GA (100 mg/m2), and AA (75 mg/m2). Results showed no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among the subtypes. However, patients with AA genotype experienced significantly higher rates of adverse events, including delayed diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia, leading to treatment switches for some. Overall, the findings suggest that irinotecan therapy may be beneficial for patients with GG/GA subtypes, while those with AA subtype seem to have limited tolerability and efficacy.",
