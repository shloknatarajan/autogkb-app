    "title": "Pharmacogenetic Factors Influence Escitalopram Pharmacokinetics and Adverse Events in Youth with a Family History of Bipolar Disorder: A Preliminary Study",
    "pmcid": "PMC10880264",
    "summary": "This preliminary study explores the pharmacogenetic factors affecting escitalopram pharmacokinetics and the risk of adverse events in adolescents aged 12-17 with a family history of bipolar disorder (BD). The study shows that CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype significantly influences escitalopram pharmacokinetics, revealing that slower metabolizers have higher drug concentrations in the body. CYP2D6, however, did not impact pharmacokinetics significantly but was associated with increased reports of akathisia. Additionally, specific HTR2A genotypes (A/A and A/G) correlated with a higher risk of self-harm and harm to others. These findings suggest a need for larger studies to ascertain the relationship between pharmacogenomics and treatment responses in this vulnerable population.",
