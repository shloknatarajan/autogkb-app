            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 genetic variants. Notably, certain OCT1 alleles resulted in a complete lack of ranitidine uptake, while others showed reduced or increased uptake, highlighting the potential for genetic polymorphisms to influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions.",
