Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 genetic variants. Notably, several OCT1 alleles showed reduced or absent ranitidine transport, while OCT2 had limited involvement, unaffected by its common polymorphism, Ala270Ser.",
