            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate for OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 genetic variants. Specifically, certain OCT1 alleles showed complete or partial loss of ranitidine transport activity, while OCT2 had limited impact on ranitidine uptake, unaffected by the Ala270Ser polymorphism.",
