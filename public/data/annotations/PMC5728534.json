            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 allelic variants, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 allele, while OCT2 showed limited ranitidine uptake unaffected by its common polymorphism. The findings highlight the potential for genetic variations in OCT1 to influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions, although the clinical implications remain to be explored.",
