        "summary": "This study investigated the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the OCT1 and OCT2 transporters on the uptake of ranitidine. Using cell lines expressing different OCT1 and OCT2 variants, the researchers found that certain OCT1 polymorphisms significantly reduced or abolished ranitidine uptake, while OCT2 had limited impact. The study highlights the potential for genetic variability to influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug interactions.",
