            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a common H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake due to common OCT1 polymorphisms, while OCT2 showed limited ranitidine uptake unaffected by its Ala270Ser polymorphism. These findings suggest that genetic variations in OCT1 can significantly influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and its potential for drug-drug interactions.",

The researchers utilized HEK293 and CHO cell lines that were stably transfected to overexpress either wild-type OCT1, OCT2, or their naturally occurring allelic variants. These cell lines served as the study population. The study did not involve human or animal subjects directly but focused on in vitro cellular models to simulate the transport activity of these genetic variants. The sample size was not explicitly mentioned in terms of the number of cell lines used, but the experiments were conducted in triplicate to ensure reliability and reproducibility of the results. The study involved characterizing ranitidine uptake by measuring intracellular concentrations using various concentrations of ranitidine and assessing the inhibitory effects on the uptake of other substrates like metformin and morphine. The researchers also compared the uptake kinetics and inhibitory potency across different OCT1 and OCT2 alleles to understand the impact of genetic variability on ranitidine transport and potential drug-drug interactions.",

It was found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with a Km of 62.9 \u03bcM and a vmax of 1125 pmol/min/mg protein. Certain OCT1 alleles, such as OCT1*5, *6, *12, and *13, completely lacked ranitidine uptake, while others like OCT1*2, *3, *4, and *10 showed a significant decrease in vmax by more than 50%. Conversely, the OCT1*8 allele exhibited a 25% increase in vmax. The study also demonstrated that ranitidine inhibited the OCT1-mediated uptake of metformin and morphine at clinically relevant concentrations, with the inhibitory potency for morphine uptake being affected by the OCT1*2 allele. OCT2 showed limited uptake of ranitidine, which was not significantly influenced by the Ala270Ser polymorphism. The findings suggest that common genetic polymorphisms in OCT1 significantly affect ranitidine uptake and its potential to cause drug-drug interactions, although the effects on ranitidine pharmacokinetics in humans remain to be further explored.
