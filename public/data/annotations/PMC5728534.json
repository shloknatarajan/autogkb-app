            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a commonly used H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake depending on the OCT1 genetic variants. While some alleles showed complete loss of ranitidine uptake, others exhibited reduced or increased transport activity, highlighting the potential for genetic polymorphisms to influence ranitidine pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions.",

Alleles OCT1*2, *3, *4, and *10 had vmax values decreased by more than 50%. In contrast, OCT1*8 showed an increase of vmax by 25%.",
