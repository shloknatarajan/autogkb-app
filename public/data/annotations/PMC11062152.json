    "pmcid": "PMC11062152",
    "summary": "This study investigates risk factors for adverse events in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with nanoliposomal irinotecan combined with 5-fluorouracil and L-leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL). It specifically highlights the association of UGT1A1*6 or *28 polymorphisms with increased risks of leukopenia and neutropenia, with a significant incidence of low white blood cell and neutrophil counts observed in homozygous patients. Additionally, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels prior to treatment and the location of tumors in the head of the pancreas were linked to further risk for leukopenia. The findings underscore the importance of monitoring genetic and clinical factors to manage treatment-related adverse effects.",
