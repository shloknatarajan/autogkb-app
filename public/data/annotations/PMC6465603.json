    "title": "NUDT15 Polymorphism Confer Increased Susceptibility to Thiopurine-Induced Leukopenia in Patients With Autoimmune Hepatitis and Related Cirrhosis",
    "pmcid": "PMC6465603",
    "summary": "This study investigates the role of NUDT15 R139C polymorphism and TPMT genotype in increasing susceptibility to thiopurine-induced leukopenia among 149 Chinese patients diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and related cirrhosis. The findings demonstrate a significant association between the NUDT15 T risk allele and the development of leukopenia following azathioprine treatment, with a notable odds ratio of 20.41. The study indicates that patients with the rs116855232 CC and CT genotypes required different azathioprine dosages to achieve safety and efficacy, highlighting the potential for personalized medication adjustments based on NUDT15 genotyping. Conversely, no significant association was noted for TPMT genotypes. The findings support routine genotyping of NUDT15 and TPMT for optimizing thiopurine therapy in this patient population.",
