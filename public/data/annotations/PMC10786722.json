    "title": "Integrating rare genetic variants into DPYD pharmacogenetic testing may help preventing fluoropyrimidine-induced toxicity",
    "pmcid": "PMC10786722",
    "summary": "This study explores the significance of rare genetic variants in the DPYD gene related to severe toxicities from fluoropyrimidine-based treatments. Conducted on nearly 3000 cancer patients, it employed next-generation sequencing to identify these variants alongside phenotyping to assess DPD enzyme activity. The findings established that incorporating rare variants into pharmacogenetic tests could enhance the prediction of DPD activity, potentially reducing toxicity in treatment regimens without compromising efficacy. The results advocate for broader and preemptive genetic testing in clinical protocols.",
