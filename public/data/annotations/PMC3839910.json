    "pmcid": "PMC3839910",
    "summary": "This study investigates the association of the genetic markers HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02 with hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine (CBZ) in children, replicating findings from adult populations. The authors analyzed 42 children with CBZ hypersensitivity against 91 tolerant controls from Canada. They found that HLA-A*31:01 was significantly associated with CBZ-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS) and maculopapular exanthems, while HLA-B*15:02 showed a strong correlation with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). This study confirms the relevance of these genetic variants across diverse pediatric populations and highlights the necessity for genetic screening to mitigate serious adverse reactions to CBZ.",
