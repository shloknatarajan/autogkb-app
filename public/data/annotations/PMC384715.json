    "pmcid": "PMC384715",
    "summary": "This study investigates the genetic basis for hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir, a drug used in HIV treatment. The authors confirm that the presence of the HLA-B*5701 allele is a strong predictor of hypersensitivity (94.4% in hypersensitive cases vs. 1.7% in tolerant controls, odds ratio of 960). They identify a potential additional susceptibility locus within the Hsp70 gene cluster that includes a variant (M493T) associated with hypersensitivity. The study shows that both HLA-B*5701 and the Hsp70-Hom M493T variant are significantly associated with abacavir hypersensitivity, suggesting a combined genotypic marker may aid in predicting risk in patients, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in clinical settings to prevent adverse drug reactions.",
