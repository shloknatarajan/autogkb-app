# Comparative efficacy and safety of sitagliptin or gliclazide combined with metformin in treatment-na誰ve patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus

## Abstract

### Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disorder requiring effective glycemic control to prevent complications. The choice of initial therapy plays a crucial role in achieving optimal outcomes.

### Objective
To compare the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin versus gliclazide, both combined with metformin, in treatment-na誰ve patients with T2DM and glucotoxicity.

### Methods
This single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled noninferiority trial compared sitagliptin plus metformin versus gliclazide plus metformin in 129 treatment-na誰ve patients with T2DM and glucotoxicity. Participants were recruited from Nanfang Hospital and randomized to receive either combination therapy for 12 weeks.

### Results
Both treatment combinations showed significant improvements in glycemic control with acceptable safety profiles. The sitagliptin plus metformin group demonstrated noninferiority to the gliclazide plus metformin group in terms of HbA1c reduction and fasting plasma glucose control.

#### Primary Endpoints
- HbA1c reduction: Significant improvement in both groups
- Fasting plasma glucose: Comparable reduction between groups
- Safety profile: Well-tolerated with minimal adverse events

#### Secondary Outcomes
- Quality of life improvements
- Weight management
- Cardiovascular risk factors

### Conclusions
Sitagliptin plus metformin demonstrated noninferiority to gliclazide plus metformin in treatment-na誰ve T2DM patients with glucotoxicity. Both combinations provide effective glycemic control with good tolerability profiles.

## Clinical Implications

This study provides valuable evidence for clinicians choosing initial combination therapy for patients with T2DM and glucotoxicity, supporting the use of either sitagliptin or gliclazide with metformin as effective first-line treatments.
