# VX-445–Tezacaftor–Ivacaftor in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis and One or Two Phe508del Alleles

## Abstract

### BACKGROUND
VX-445 is a next-generation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) corrector designed to restore Phe508del CFTR protein function in patients with cystic fibrosis when administered with tezacaftor and ivacaftor (VX-445–tezacaftor–ivacaftor).

### METHODS
We evaluated the effects of VX-445–tezacaftor–ivacaftor on Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells. On the basis of in vitro activity, a randomized, controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging, phase 2 trial was conducted to evaluate tezacaftor–ivacaftor in patients heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a minimal-function mutation (Phe508del–MF) and in patients homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation (Phe508del–Phe508del) after tezacaftor–ivacaftor run-in. Primary end points were safety and absolute change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from baseline.

### RESULTS
In vitro, VX-445–tezacaftor–ivacaftor significantly improved Phe508del CFTR protein processing, trafficking, and chloride transport to a greater extent than any two of these agents in dual combination. In patients with cystic fibrosis, VX-445–tezacaftor–ivacaftor had an acceptable safety and side-effect profile. Most adverse events were mild or moderate. The treatment also resulted in an increased percentage of predicted FEV1 of up to 13.8 points in the primary analysis group (P<0.001). In patients in the Phe508del–Phe508del group, who were already receiving tezacaftor–ivacaftor, the addition of VX-445 resulted in an 11.0-point increase in the percentage of predicted FEV1 (P<0.001). In both groups, there was a decrease in sweat chloride concentrations and improvement in the respiratory domain score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised.

### CONCLUSIONS
The use of VX-445–tezacaftor–ivacaftor to target Phe508del CFTR protein resulted in increased CFTR function in vitro and translated to improvements in patients with cystic fibrosis with one or two Phe508del alleles. This approach has the potential to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in approximately 90% of patients.

## Study Details

This study represents a significant advancement in cystic fibrosis treatment, demonstrating the efficacy of triple combination therapy in targeting the underlying protein defect that causes the disease.

### Clinical Significance

The results show that VX-445 combined with tezacaftor and ivacaftor can significantly improve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis, offering hope for better treatment outcomes.

### Future Directions

Further research will focus on long-term efficacy and safety profiles, as well as potential applications in pediatric populations.
