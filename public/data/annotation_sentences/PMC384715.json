    "summary": "## Background\nAbacavir is an antiretroviral associated with a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). This study genotyped 248 abacavir-exposed individuals (18 definite HSR; 230 tolerant) to fine-map MHC-based susceptibility and evaluate how genetic variants predict HSR risk.\n\n## Key Findings\n- HLA-B*57:01 showed a very strong association with abacavir HSR:\n  - Present in 94.4% of HSR cases vs 1.7% of controls; OR 960; Pc < 0.00001; PPV 78.9%, NPV 99.4%.\n- A nonsynonymous variant in Hsp70-Hom (HSPA1L) M493T (rs2227956) was enriched in cases:\n  - Present in 94.4% of cases vs 22.2% of controls; OR 59.7; Pc < 0.00001; PPV 25.4%.\n- The combination of HLA-B*57:01 plus HSPA1L M493T provided maximal discrimination:\n  - Present in 94.4% of cases vs 0.4% of controls; OR 3,893; Pc < 0.00001; PPV 93.8%, NPV 99.5%; improved classification over HLA-B*57:01 alone (P = 0.003).\n  - Strong linkage disequilibrium between HLA-B*57:01 and HSPA1L M493T (relative LD 0.82).\n- Other 57.1 ancestral haplotype markers (C4A6; HLA-DRB1*07:01/HLA-DQ3) were associated but less discriminating individually; the full 57.1 haplotype was present in 14/18 cases and 0/230 controls.\n- Functional data support an HLA class I-restricted mechanism: abacavir stimulation increased monocyte TNF in HSR patients, which was abrogated by CD8+ T-cell depletion.\n- Notably, one tolerant individual carried both HLA-B*57:01 and HSPA1L M493T, indicating additional factors may influence risk.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Pre-emptive HLA-B*57:01 testing is highly effective for preventing abacavir HSR; in the prospective subset, no HSR occurred among HLA-B*57:01-negative individuals on abacavir.\n- Adding HSPA1L M493T to HLA-B*57:01 testing may further increase specificity and reduce unnecessary exclusion from abacavir (estimated inappropriate denial reduced from 1.6% with HLA-B*57:01 alone to 0.4% with the combination in this cohort).\n- Practical takeaway: Screen all candidates for abacavir with HLA-B*57:01; consider that concurrent HSPA1L M493T markedly enriches risk within carriers, though rare tolerant carriers exist. Findings are most immediately applicable to populations of European ancestry and warrant functional and external validation before routine dual-marker testing."
