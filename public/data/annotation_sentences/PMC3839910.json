    "summary": "## Background\nCarbamazepine (CBZ) can cause hypersensitivity reactions ranging from mild rashes to life-threatening Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). This pediatric case–control study from Canada (42 CBZ hypersensitivity cases; 91 CBZ-tolerant controls) evaluated two HLA markers previously implicated in adults—HLA-A*31:01 and HLA-B*15:02—across a multiethnic cohort of children.\n\n## Key Findings\n- HLA-A*31:01 was strongly associated with non-SJS/TEN hypersensitivity:\n  - Hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS): OR 26.4; p=0.0025 (3/6 cases vs 3/91 controls).\n  - Maculopapular exanthema (MPE): OR 8.6; p=0.0037 (6/26 cases).\n  - Combined HSS/MPE: OR 11.2; p=2.6×10^-4.\n  - No association with SJS/TEN (0/9 cases; p=1.00).\n- HLA-B*15:02 was specifically associated with SJS/TEN: OR 38.6; p≈0.002 (3/9 SJS/TEN cases; all of Asian ancestry); not associated with HSS or MPE (no carriers).\n- Combined risk marker analysis (HLA-A*31:01 or HLA-B*15:02): 28.6% of cases vs 4.6% of controls; OR 8.14; p=2.6×10^-4. Estimated positive post-test probability 25–41% assuming a 5–10% baseline risk; negative post-test probability 3.8–7.7%.\n- The proxy SNP rs1061235T (often linked to HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans) was associated with HSS/MPE (OR 9.45; p=2.6×10^-5) but was not a reliable surrogate across non-European ancestries.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Test HLA-B*15:02 before CBZ initiation to prevent SJS/TEN; avoid CBZ in carriers. Although most common in Asian populations, testing is advisable regardless of reported ancestry in diverse settings.\n- Test HLA-A*31:01 to assess risk of HSS/MPE across ancestries; consider alternative therapy in carriers.\n- Do not rely on rs1061235 as a standalone proxy for HLA-A*31:01 in multiethnic populations; use direct HLA typing.\n- While these markers are neither necessary nor sufficient for reaction, the severity of outcomes and availability of alternatives support preemptive HLA genotyping in children prior to CBZ therapy."
