    "summary": "## Background\nCarbamazepine can trigger immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions ranging from maculopapular exanthema to severe Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). While HLA-B*15:02 strongly predicts carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN in many Asian populations, it does not explain risk in Europeans. This study performed genomewide association analyses in individuals of European ancestry to identify genetic risk factors for carbamazepine hypersensitivity.\n\n## Key Findings\n- HLA-A*31:01 was strongly associated with the full spectrum of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions in Europeans:\n  - Hypersensitivity syndrome/DRESS: genomewide significant signal near HLA-A; confirmed association with HLA-A*31:01 (OR 12.41; 95% CI 1.27–121.03; P=0.03 after follow-up; discovery P=3.5×10−8).\n  - Maculopapular exanthema: HLA-A*31:01 association (P=1.1×10−6 in GWAS; combined OR 8.33; 95% CI 3.59–19.36; P=8.0×10−7).\n  - SJS/TEN: HLA-A*31:01 carriers were overrepresented (OR 25.93; 95% CI 4.93–116.18; P=8.0×10−5).\n  - Pooled across all phenotypes: OR 9.12 (95% CI 4.03–20.65; P=1.0×10−7).\n- Test performance in Europeans: sensitivity 26%, specificity 96%; positive likelihood ratio 6.74 and negative likelihood ratio 0.77.\n- Absolute risk estimates (assuming 5% baseline prevalence): presence of HLA-A*31:01 increases risk to 26.0%; absence lowers risk to 3.8%.\n- The proxy SNP rs1061235 is in complete linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A*31:01 in Europeans; high-resolution HLA typing confirmed the allele-level association. HLA-A*31:01 frequency is ~2–5% in Northern Europeans.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- In patients of European ancestry, HLA-A*31:01 is a clinically relevant predictor of carbamazepine hypersensitivity across mild (maculopapular exanthema) to severe (SJS/TEN) phenotypes. Consider pre-prescription HLA-A*31:01 testing:\n  - If positive: substantial increase in risk; consider alternative antiseizure medications and avoid carbamazepine when possible.\n  - If negative: risk is reduced but not eliminated; proceed with caution and monitor closely.\n- These findings complement ancestry-specific guidance: HLA-B*15:02 remains critical for SJS/TEN risk in many Asian populations, whereas HLA-A*31:01 is the key marker in Europeans.\n- Population impact: at a 5–10% prevalence of carbamazepine hypersensitivity, approximately 83–39 patients would need to be screened to prevent one case, supporting the potential value of integrating HLA-A*31:01 testing into clinical decision-making for carbamazepine initiation in Europeans."
