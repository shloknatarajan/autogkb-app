    "summary": "## Background\n- This retrospective study evaluated pharmacogenomic risk factors for adverse events with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (nal-IRI/FL) in 36 Japanese patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, focusing on UGT1A1*6 and *28 variants that reduce SN-38 glucuronidation.\n\n## Key Findings\n- UGT1A1 risk genotypes:\n  - Patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for UGT1A1*6 or *28 (i.e., *6/*6, *28/*28, or *6/*28; termed “+/+”) had significantly lower nadir white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil (ANC) counts versus wild-type or single heterozygotes:\n    - WBC nadir: median 2,050 vs 3,220–3,340/mm3; p=0.033\n    - ANC nadir: median 860 vs 1,285–1,930/mm3; p=0.043\n  - In multivariable models, UGT1A1 (+/+) independently predicted lower WBC (p=0.009) and lower ANC (p=0.017).\n  - Grade 3–4 leukopenia/neutropenia occurred in 50% of UGT1A1 (+/+) patients vs 7.1–12.5% in others (trend, p=0.085), despite lower starting nal-IRI doses in the (+/+) group.\n- Non-genetic factors:\n  - Higher baseline AST (p=0.019) and pancreatic head tumor location (p=0.030) independently associated with lower WBC nadir.\n- Diarrhea:\n  - No significant predictors (including UGT1A1) were identified for grade ≥1 diarrhea in this cohort, noting limited power and exclusion of patients on prophylactic loperamide.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Genotype-guided risk stratification:\n  - UGT1A1*6/*6, *28/*28, or *6/*28 identifies patients at high risk for myelosuppression on nal-IRI/FL. Consider reduced starting nal-IRI doses, closer CBC monitoring, and proactive neutropenia management.\n- Broader risk assessment:\n  - Elevated AST and pancreatic head tumors further increase leukopenia risk; optimize biliary drainage/liver function and intensify monitoring in these patients.\n- Practical note:\n  - While severe neutropenia rates showed a strong trend rather than statistical significance, consistent and significant reductions in WBC/ANC nadirs support incorporating UGT1A1 genotype (and baseline liver parameters) into treatment planning. Larger prospective studies are warranted for confirmation."
