    "summary": "## Background\nTamoxifen’s anticancer activity is driven largely by its active metabolite, endoxifen, which is formed primarily by CYP2D6. This exploratory study assessed how CYP2D6 variants affect endoxifen exposure and whether endoxifen levels relate to breast cancer recurrence in 224 Filipino and Vietnamese women on adjuvant tamoxifen.\n\n## Key Findings\n- CYP2D6 genotyping included alleles *1, *2 (normal function), and reduced/nonfunctional variants *10, *41, *3, *4, *5, *6. The reduced-function allele *10 was very common (≈52–59%).\n- Endoxifen concentrations tracked with CYP2D6 metabolic status: normal > intermediate > slow (p for trend ≈0.0001). Mean endoxifen (ng/mL): normal 48.2, intermediate 39.3, slow 25.0. CYP2D6 explained about 10% of endoxifen variability (r^2 ≈0.086). Associations with other metabolites were weaker (4-OH-tamoxifen p=0.13; N-desmethyltamoxifen p=0.060; tamoxifen p=0.39).\n- In a matched nested case–control subset (n=48), a J-shaped relationship was observed between endoxifen levels and recurrence risk: both low and high levels appeared unfavorable, with the highest risk at high endoxifen (>70 ng/mL). A quadratic trend in a stratified Cox model was significant (likelihood ratio p=0.002). Among pairs with low endoxifen, 8/9 recurrences had lower levels than their matched controls.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- CYP2D6 genotype (especially prevalent reduced-function variants like *10 and *41, or null alleles *3–*6) identifies patients prone to lower endoxifen exposure, but genotype alone explains only a modest fraction of variability; other factors drive most of the differences.\n- Findings support the concept of an optimal therapeutic range for endoxifen and suggest that both subtherapeutic and very high levels (e.g., >70 ng/mL) may be associated with worse outcomes. This argues for considering endoxifen therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly in populations with high rates of reduced-function CYP2D6 alleles.\n- Because the recurrence analysis is exploratory and based on a small subset, results should be validated before practice changes. In the interim, combining CYP2D6 genotyping with endoxifen level monitoring may be more informative than relying on genotype alone when individualizing tamoxifen therapy."
