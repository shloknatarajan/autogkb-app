    "summary": "## Background\nThis single-center cohort study genotyped 37 SNPs across 14 ADME genes in both donors and recipients (n=79 kidney transplants; all on tacrolimus) and followed patients for 12 years. The authors assessed associations between pharmacogene variants and long-term outcomes (survival, tumors, rejection, nephrotoxicity, infections, renal function) and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics (dose-adjusted trough, C/D).\n\n## Key Findings\n- Survival and tumors (donor transport genes were influential):\n  - Donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA was linked to lower mortality risk (OR 0.116; p=0.029 FDR) and better survival vs AG (log-rank p=0.042), but higher infection risk (OR 23.8; p=0.005).\n  - Donor ABCC2 rs2273697 GA increased mortality (OR 4.13; p=0.021); ABCC2 rs2273697 GG had the best survival (log-rank p=0.003). The same donor variant increased tumor risk (AA OR 13.09; GA OR 3.39; p≈0.04–0.06).\n  - Recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT was associated with lower tumor incidence (OR 0.099; p=0.048).\n\n- Rejection, nephrotoxicity, infections, re-transplantation:\n  - Chronic rejection: reduced with donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GA (OR 0.133; p=0.016).\n  - Acute rejection: reduced with recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA (OR 0.080; p=0.047), recipient SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT (OR 0.157; p=0.024), and donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT (OR 0.199; p=0.027); increased with donor UGT1A9 rs6714486 TA (OR 32.1; p=0.020; sparse genotypes).\n  - Nephrotoxicity: reduced with recipient SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AA (OR 0.076; p=0.009) and AG (OR 0.227; p=0.051), donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG (OR 0.108; p=0.024), and donor NOD2 rs2066844 CC (OR 0.015; p=0.035); increased with donor CYP2C19 rs4244285 AA (CYP2C19*2; OR 11.65; p=0.026).\n  - Infections: reduced with recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 CC (OR 0.087; p=0.003); increased with donor ABCB1 rs9282564 AA (OR 23.8; p=0.005).\n  - Re-transplant: reduced with donor TPMT rs1142345 AA (OR 0.048; p=0.020) and donor CYP2C9 rs1799853 CC (OR 0.102; p=0.042).\n\n- Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics and renal function:\n  - Higher tacrolimus C/D with recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA (p<0.001), recipient CYP3A5 rs776746 *3/*3 (p<0.001), donor CYP2C19 rs4244285 AA (notably >3 years; p=0.026), recipient ABCB1 rs1045642 TT and rs2235033 TT (both p=0.005), and recipient SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT (p=0.002). Donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GG showed lower C/D (p=0.011); donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 affected early C/D (p=0.01).\n  - Better eGFR recovery with recipient CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA (p<0.001); donor CYP3A5 *3/*3 and recipient CYP2B6 rs3745274 GT favored higher clearance, while donor CYP2B6 rs3745274 TT was unfavorable.\n  - Variant combinations across metabolizing (CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19) and transporter (ABCB1, ABCC2, SLCO1B1) genes further modified risks (e.g., donor ABCC2 rs2273697 GG plus donor/recipient CYP2C19 rs4244285 AG/AA lowered tumor risk; several CYP2B6–ABCB1/SLCO1B1 pairs increased rejection, nephrotoxicity, or diabetes; ORs typically >5 or <0.2).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Genotyping both donor and recipient can inform long-term risk stratification and tacrolimus management.\n  - Dose/monitoring: anticipate higher tacrolimus exposure with recipient CYP3A5*3/*3, CYP3A4 rs2740574 AA, SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT, and donor CYP2C19*2; consider lower initial doses and closer trough/eGFR monitoring to mitigate nephrotoxicity.\n  - Surveillance: donors carrying ABCC2 rs2273697 A (AA/GA) and/or ABCB1 rs9282564 AA identify recipients who may need intensified cancer, infection, and survival-focused follow-up.\n  - Graft outcomes: donor ABCB1 rs2235013 GA and recipient SLCO1B1 rs4149056 TT associate with less rejection; recipient SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AA/AG and donor SLCO1B1 rs2306283 AG are protective against nephrotoxicity.\n- Findings support panel-based pharmacogenetic testing in kidney transplantation to tailor tacrolimus dosing and long-term monitoring. Given the modest sample and single-center design, use these markers to complement, not replace, therapeutic drug monitoring and clinical judgment, and seek validation when possible."
