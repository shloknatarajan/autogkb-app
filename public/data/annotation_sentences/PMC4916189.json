    "summary": "## Background\nENCORE1 compared once-daily efavirenz 400 mg (EFV400) versus 600 mg (EFV600) in 606 treatment-naïve adults with HIV across diverse ancestries, assessing pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics at 96 weeks. The study genotyped variants in CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A4, NR1I3, NR1I2, and ABCB1, and related them to virologic suppression, adverse events (AEs), and treatment discontinuation.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Virologic efficacy: No genetic variant tested was associated with achieving plasma HIV RNA <200 copies/mL at 96 weeks (overall suppression ~98%). This included CYP2B6 516G>T (rs3745274), 983T>C (rs28399499), 15582C>T (rs4803419); CYP2A6*9B (rs8192726), *17 (rs28399454); CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367); NR1I3 540C>T (rs2307424), 1089T>C (rs3003596); NR1I2 63396C>T (rs2472677), 7635A>G (rs6785049); and ABCB1 3435C>T (rs1045642) (all p>0.05).\n- Central nervous system (CNS) AEs:\n  - CYP2B6 983TC/CC was protective (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12–0.75; p=0.010).\n  - CYP2B6 15582CT/TT increased risk (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.11–2.27; p=0.011).\n  - ABCB1 3435TT increased risk (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.25–3.67; p=0.006).\n  - CNS AEs were not driven by efavirenz dose or plasma levels.\n- Overall discontinuation:\n  - CYP2B6 516GT (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.01–3.21; p=0.047) and 516TT (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.26–5.60; p=0.010) increased risk.\n  - CYP2A6*9B CA/AA increased risk (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.14–3.52; p=0.016).\n  - NR1I2 63396TT decreased risk (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07–0.67; p=0.008).\n- Dose effect: EFV600 increased stopping due to clinician-judged EFV-related AEs versus EFV400 (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.19–5.43; p=0.016), and this higher AE rate was not explained by the genotypes assessed.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Genotyping is not needed to predict virologic success on efavirenz; common variants tested did not impact suppression at 96 weeks.\n- Genetic information may help anticipate tolerability:\n  - Higher CNS AE risk with CYP2B6 15582T and ABCB1 3435TT; lower risk with CYP2B6 983C carriers.\n  - Greater likelihood of overall discontinuation with CYP2B6 516T and CYP2A6*9B variants; reduced discontinuation with NR1I2 63396TT.\n  - For patients with high-risk genotypes who require efavirenz, consider closer AE monitoring and counseling; alternatives may be considered if CNS toxicity develops.\n- EFV400 provides similar efficacy with fewer AE-related discontinuations irrespective of genotype, supporting use of the 400 mg dose to improve tolerability."
