This study measured 12-hour post-dose steady-state plasma simvastatin (lactone and acid) and genotyped key pharmacokinetic genes in 89 Thai patients on stable simvastatin to evaluate genotype–exposure relationships.\n\n## Key Findings\n- SLCO1B1 (OATP1B1) variants were the primary determinants of simvastatin acid levels:\n  - rs4149056 (c.521T>C): Carriers (TC; no CC observed) had higher SVA than TT (median 0.53 vs 0.19 ng/mL; p=0.03). C-allele frequency was 5.1% (TC 10.1%).\n  - Diplotypes: SLCO1B1*1b/*15 (decreased function) had higher SVA than *1a/*1a (0.58 vs 0.16 ng/mL; p<0.001). Grouped by phenotype, decreased OATP1B1 function (*1b/*5, *1b/*15) trended to higher SVA vs normal function (0.53 vs 0.19 ng/mL; p=0.07).\n- Dose subgroup (10 mg/day):\n  - rs4149056 TC carriers showed higher SVA than TT (5.83 vs 1.95 ng/mL; p=0.06).\n  - rs2306283 (c.388A>G): G-allele carriers (AG+GG) had higher SVA than AA (3.63 vs 1.59 ng/mL; p=0.04). Across all doses, rs2306283 was not associated with SVA.\n- No significant associations with simvastatin acid or lactone were found for: ABCB1 rs1045642, ABCC2 rs717620/rs3740066, ABCG2 rs2231142, SLCO1B3 rs7311358/rs4149117, CYP3A4*1G rs2242480, or CYP3A5*3 rs776746.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C) and the decreased-function diplotype *1b/*15 identify Thai patients with higher simvastatin acid exposure, consistent with reduced OATP1B1 activity and increased myotoxicity risk.\n- When SLCO1B1 genotype is known, follow CPIC 2022 guidance: consider lower simvastatin doses or switching to a statin with less OATP1B1 dependence in decreased/poor function phenotypes to mitigate muscle toxicity risk.\n- Other tested transporters/enzymes did not meaningfully affect exposure in this cohort. Findings support prioritizing SLCO1B1 genotyping (rs4149056, and haplotypes involving rs2306283) to guide simvastatin therapy in Thai patients. Larger studies are warranted to refine dose-specific recommendations and link exposure to clinical outcomes."
