    "summary": "## Background\nThis study evaluated how CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 genetic variants affect plasma levels of efavirenz and nevirapine when co-administered with rifampicin in HIV/TB co-infected Thai adults. Participants received standard-dose efavirenz (600 mg/day; n=65) or nevirapine (400 mg/day; n=59) alongside rifampicin-based TB therapy.\n\n## Key Findings\n- CYP2B6 516G>T (rs3745274) was the primary determinant of NNRTI exposure. Individuals with the TT genotype had markedly higher 12-hour post-dose efavirenz concentrations than GT or GG at:\n  - Week 6: TT 10.97 mg/L vs GT 3.43 vs GG 2.88 (p<0.0001)\n  - Week 12: TT 13.62 vs GT 3.35 vs GG 2.45 (p<0.0001)\n  - 1 month after stopping rifampicin: TT 8.48 vs GT 3.21 vs GG 2.08 (p<0.0001)\n- For nevirapine, TT carriers tended to have higher levels:\n  - Week 6: TT 14.09 mg/L vs GT 5.65 vs GG 5.42 (p=0.003); Week 12 and post-rifampicin differences were not statistically significant (p=0.409 and 0.448).\n- Rifampicin’s effect on drug levels was small compared with the genotype effect:\n  - Efavirenz decreased modestly after rifampicin discontinuation (mean 4.26 to 3.50 mg/L; p=0.043).\n  - Nevirapine increased modestly after rifampicin discontinuation (5.83 to 6.84 mg/L; p=0.034).\n- Other tested variants showed no meaningful associations in this cohort due to limited variability: CYP2B6 C777A, A415G, C1459T and CYP3A4 T566C, T878C, C1088T (only rare CYP3A4 T878C heterozygotes observed).\n- Virologic response: there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher rates of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at week 12 among CYP2B6 516TT carriers (efavirenz group: 88.9% TT vs 77.4% GT vs 68.0% GG; p=0.430; similar trend in nevirapine group with small numbers).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- CYP2B6 516TT identifies poor metabolizers with substantially elevated efavirenz (and to a lesser extent nevirapine) exposure, even during rifampicin co-therapy; rifampicin induction does not overcome the genotype effect.\n- Consider genotype-informed management when using efavirenz or nevirapine with rifampicin:\n  - For efavirenz, TT carriers may benefit from closer therapeutic drug monitoring and, where feasible, dose reduction to mitigate concentration-related adverse effects, while maintaining efficacy.\n  - Standard dosing generally achieved therapeutic concentrations across genotypes, but monitoring is prudent in TT carriers given high exposures.\n- Routine testing of other CYP2B6/CYP3A4 variants examined here appears less actionable in this population; the CYP2B6 516G>T variant is the key pharmacogenetic marker guiding NNRTI exposure with concurrent rifampicin."
