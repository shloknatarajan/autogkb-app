    "summary": "## Background\nThis retrospective nested case–control study evaluated 82 Chilean patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimens (often with oxaliplatin). Sixteen variants across TYMS, TYMP, DPYD, GSTP1, MTHFR, ERCC2, ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC4, and ABCG2 were genotyped to identify associations with chemotherapy adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and to build preliminary predictive models.\n\n## Key Findings\n- DPYD\n  - rs1801265 (c.85T>C; DPYD*9): C allele associated with higher neuropathy risk (dominant model OR 4.58; p=0.05; codominant T/C OR 30.0; p=0.0049). Classic DPYD loss-of-function variants (rs3918290, rs55886062) showed no variability in this cohort.\n- GSTP1\n  - rs1695 (c.313A>G): G allele was protective against neuropathy (OR 0.147; p=0.012) and hematological toxicity (dominant OR 0.298; p=0.001; recessive OR 0.157; p=0.0005), but increased mucositis risk (OR 2.27; p=0.036).\n- TYMS\n  - rs11280056 (3′UTR 6-bp del): Deletion genotype reduced gastrointestinal and hematologic ADRs (DEL/DEL OR 0.029 for hematologic; p=0.001; dominant OR 0.107; p<0.0001) and lowered risk of severe hematologic toxicity (OR 0.098; p=0.005).\n  - rs45445694 (5′UTR TSER): 3R/3R genotype increased skin/subcutaneous toxicity (OR 6.40; p=0.029).\n- ERCC2\n  - rs13181 (c.2251A>C): CC genotype associated with lower gastrointestinal toxicity (OR 0.100; p=0.045); in a multivariate model, CC genotype increased pain risk (OR 6.27; p=0.034).\n- MTHFR\n  - rs1801131 (A1298C): C allele reduced pain risk (dominant OR 0.375; p=0.048; A/C OR 0.355; p=0.042) but increased risk of nervous system disorders (dominant OR 5.81; p=0.035).\n- ABCB1 and TYMP\n  - ABCB1 rs1128503: C/C genotype associated with higher pain risk (OR 4.20; p=0.049).\n  - TYMP rs11479: T allele increased pain risk; in an anemia model, T/T strongly predicted anemia (OR 23.76; p=0.038).\n- Predictive models\n  - Anemia: TYMP rs11479 (T/T) + ABCB1 rs1045642 (T/T, trend) yielded a model with AUC ~0.71; p=0.027.\n  - Pain: ERCC2 rs13181 (C/C) + MTHFR rs1801131 (A/C+C/C) produced AUC ~0.75; p=0.01.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Preemptive DPYD testing remains essential; although classic loss-of-function alleles were rare here, the common DPYD rs1801265 C allele may flag higher neuropathy risk, especially relevant with oxaliplatin-containing regimens.\n- GSTP1 rs1695 can help anticipate trade-offs: carriers of G may need closer mucositis monitoring but could be at lower risk for neuropathy and hematologic toxicity.\n- TYMS variants may guide safety expectations: the 3′UTR 6-bp deletion signals lower hematologic (including severe) and GI toxicity risk, while 5′UTR 3R/3R suggests higher skin toxicity risk.\n- Multigene signals for pain and anemia (ERCC2, MTHFR, TYMP, ABCB1) show moderate predictive performance and could inform supportive care and monitoring, but require external validation before routine use.\n- Overall, these findings support integrating pharmacogenetics with clinical factors to personalize 5-FU-based therapy safety in Chilean CRC patients; larger, prospective studies are needed to confirm and operationalize these associations for dosing and toxicity prevention."
