    "summary": "## Background\nThis matched case–control analysis from the ABCSG-8 trial evaluated whether CYP2D6 genotype influences outcomes with adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer. Patients received either 5 years of tamoxifen (Arm A) or 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of anastrozole (Arm B). Genotyping targeted CYP2D6 null alleles (poor-function: *3, *4, *6) and reduced-function alleles (*10, *41), and patients were grouped by predicted phenotype: extensive (EM/EM), intermediate (EM/IM or IM/IM), one null allele (PM/EM or PM/IM), and poor metabolizer (PM/PM; two null alleles).\n\n## Key Findings\n- Tamoxifen monotherapy (Arm A, years 1–5): Poor metabolizers (PM/PM) had a significantly higher odds of a disease event versus EM/EM (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.05–5.73; p=0.04). Carriers of one null allele (PM/EM or PM/IM) showed a trend toward higher risk (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.95–2.93; p=0.07). Reduced-function alleles alone (EM/IM or IM/IM; largely driven by *10 and *41) were not associated with increased risk (OR 1.23; 95% CI 0.58–2.61; p=0.60).\n- Early tamoxifen phase (years 1–2, both arms): PM/PM showed a similar, non-significant trend toward higher risk compared with EM/EM (Arm A OR 2.54, p=0.25; Arm B OR 2.60, p=0.46), though event numbers were small.\n- Years 3–5 by treatment: Among women continuing tamoxifen (Arm A), PM/PM trended toward higher risk (OR 2.40; 95% CI 0.86–6.66; p=0.09). Among women who switched to anastrozole (Arm B), no increased risk was observed for PM/PM (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.03–2.30; p=0.23) or for carriers of one null allele (OR 0.63; p=0.22). Across the full 5-year period in Arm B, CYP2D6 genotype was not associated with outcomes.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- The adverse impact of reduced CYP2D6 metabolism on recurrence risk appears confined to the period of tamoxifen therapy and is not seen after switching to anastrozole. This supports the strategy of AI sequencing after initial tamoxifen, regardless of CYP2D6 genotype.\n- For patients expected to remain on tamoxifen long term, those with poor-metabolizer genotypes (two null alleles, commonly involving *4 and less commonly *3 or *6) are at higher risk of early events; alternatives such as earlier AI use, avoiding strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, or considering pharmacologic monitoring of endoxifen could be contemplated.\n- Limitations relevant to clinical use: the CYP2D6*5 gene deletion and gene duplications were not assayed, and concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitor use was unknown. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether genotype-guided therapy or endoxifen-guided dosing improves outcomes."
