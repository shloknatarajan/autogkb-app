    "summary": "## Background\nClopidogrel requires metabolic activation via CYP2C19. Loss‑of‑function (LOF) variants reduce active metabolite formation and may blunt antiplatelet effect. This prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial in South Korea evaluated whether CYP2C19 genotype predicts cardiovascular outcomes in 2910 adults who started clopidogrel within 72 hours of acute ischemic stroke.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Genotype groups: LOF carriers (intermediate or poor metabolizers; any CYP2C19*2 or *3 allele, including *1/*2, *1/*3, *2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3, *2/*17, *3/*17) vs noncarriers (extensive metabolizers; *1/*1, *1/*17, *17/*17).\n- Primary outcome (6‑month composite of stroke [ischemic or hemorrhagic], myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death) occurred more often in LOF carriers: 2.7% (49/1785) vs 1.6% (18/1125); noncarriers had lower risk (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.33‑0.99; log‑rank P = .048). Association persisted after multivariable adjustment (adjusted HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.33‑0.99; P = .049).\n- Recurrent stroke was higher in LOF carriers: 2.5% vs 1.4% (HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.32‑1.00; P = .047). Individual myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death rates did not differ significantly.\n- Safety did not differ by genotype: major bleeding 0.6% vs 0.8% (P = .56); all‑cause mortality 0.3% vs 0.1% (P = .27).\n- Within LOF carriers, intermediate vs poor metabolizers had similar outcomes (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.49‑1.88; P = .92).\n- Subgroup: among smokers, noncarriers had markedly fewer primary events than carriers (HR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01‑0.64; interaction P = .03).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- CYP2C19 LOF alleles (*2, *3) identify patients with ischemic stroke who are less protected by clopidogrel against recurrent cardiovascular events, without an offsetting reduction in bleeding. Genotypes lacking LOF alleles (including *17 gain‑of‑function or *1 normal alleles) show better effectiveness.\n- Routine CYP2C19 genotyping can inform antiplatelet selection after ischemic stroke, particularly in East Asian populations where LOF alleles are common. For LOF carriers, consider antiplatelet strategies not dependent on CYP2C19 activation (e.g., ticagrelor‑based regimens) and close monitoring for recurrent ischemic events, with attention to smokers who may derive particular benefit from genotype‑guided therapy."
