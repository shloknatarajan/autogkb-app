Children are particularly susceptible to risperidone-related adverse events (AEs), but data on how CYP2D6 genetic variation affects AE risk in pediatrics have been limited and mixed. This retrospective cohort study (n=257; ≤18 years; ≥4 weeks of risperidone) evaluated whether CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype predicts AEs using genotype-derived phenotypes (poor, intermediate, normal, ultrarapid).\n\n## Key Findings\n- Overall, 30% experienced AEs; most common were weight change (9%), sedation (6%), and extrapyramidal symptoms (6%).\n- AE rates were higher in CYP2D6 poor/intermediate metabolizers vs normal/ultrarapid: 46% (15/33) vs 27% (61/224), P=0.04.\n- After adjusting for age, sex, race, and starting dose, poor/intermediate metabolizers had a 2.4-fold higher odds of AEs (adjusted OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.1–5.1; P=0.03).\n- By phenotype: AEs occurred in 33% of poor, 56% of intermediate, 27% of normal, and 50% of ultrarapid metabolizers (ultrarapid group was small, n=6).\n- Concomitant strong CYP2D6 inhibitor use among normal/ultrarapid metabolizers did not significantly affect AE risk (adjusted OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.4–3.3; P=0.7).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Children with reduced CYP2D6 function (poor or intermediate metabolizers) are at significantly higher risk of risperidone AEs. If genotype is known, consider an alternative antipsychotic with less CYP2D6 dependence, or start risperidone at a lower dose with slow titration and enhanced monitoring (weight/metabolic parameters and movement disorders).\n- Ultrarapid metabolizers may also warrant added vigilance, though evidence is limited due to small numbers.\n- Genotype appears to be a stronger predictor of AE risk than concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitor use in this setting, supporting the potential value of pre-prescription CYP2D6 testing to guide safer pediatric risperidone therapy."
