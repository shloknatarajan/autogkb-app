    "summary": "## Background\nNevirapine (NVP) is an NNRTI with a ~5% risk of clinically significant cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). This case–control study (151 cases, 413 controls) across Asian, African, and Caucasian ancestries used high‑resolution HLA typing and a binding‑pocket–based analytic approach to explain multi-allelic HLA associations with NVP cutaneous HSR and to identify risk and protective variants.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Primary risk (HLA-C, F-pocket cluster):\n  - HLA-C*04:01 was the strongest and most consistent risk allele across ancestries (overall OR 3.06, p=0.0001; multivariable OR 4.06 [2.39–6.88]). Ancestry-specific ORs: Asian 5.49 (p=0.0001), Caucasian 2.08 (p=0.02), African 3.84 (p=0.04).\n  - Additional HLA-C alleles sharing the HLA-C*04:01 F-pocket motif also conferred risk: HLA-C*05:01 (Caucasians; OR 2.84, p=0.002) and HLA-C*18:01 (Africans; trend).\n  - Modeling supports NVP docking within the HLA-C F pocket, consistent with a shared structural mechanism of risk.\n- Protective HLA-B cluster (B62 supertype, B-pocket):\n  - A cluster defined by a characteristic hydrophobic B pocket—HLA-B*15:01/12/24/25/27/32/35 and HLA-B*52:01—was protective, independent of HLA-C risk (OR ~0.18, p≈1–3×10^-4).\n- Secondary HLA-B risk:\n  - HLA-B*35:05 (unique E/F pocket motif) showed risk, frequently co-occurring with HLA-C*04:01 in Southeast Asians (suggesting synergy). Broader risk groups included B07 supertype members (e.g., B*51/54/55/56) and B27-related B*38/39; multivariable ORs: 2.32 [1.42–3.79] (B07 risk group) and 1.76 [1.02–3.02] (non‑B07 risk group).\n  - HLA-A showed little effect.\n- HLA class II (DRB1, P4-pocket cluster):\n  - HLA-DRB1*01:01/01:02/01:03 and DRB1*04:04/04:05/04:08/04:10 were associated with increased risk (overall OR 2.00 [1.23–3.24]). DRB1*04:01 and *04:15 appeared protective in Caucasians, implicating β71 in the DRB1 P4 pocket as a key determinant.\n- Metabolic gene:\n  - CYP2B6 slow metabolizer genotype independently increased risk (OR 2.07 [1.12–3.82]).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Risk stratification for NVP cutaneous HSR should prioritize HLA-C*04:01 and related F-pocket risk alleles (e.g., C*05:01, C*18:01), consider secondary contributors (HLA-B*35:05, DRB1*01/*04 P4-pocket cluster), and account for CYP2B6 slow metabolizer status.\n- Presence of protective HLA-B B62 alleles (e.g., B*15:01, B*52:01) lowers risk but should not be used alone to select NVP.\n- In settings where NVP is considered, targeted pre-treatment genotyping (HLA-C risk cluster ± HLA-B*35:05; DRB1 risk cluster; CYP2B6) could inform alternative regimen selection or intensified early monitoring, especially in Southeast Asians (HLA-C*04:01 + B*35:05 linkage) and populations with higher frequencies of the HLA-C risk cluster.\n- These findings support a structural mechanism—drug interaction within specific HLA binding pockets—underpinning multi-allelic risk, reinforcing the value of pocket-informed HLA panels over single-allele tests for predicting T cell–mediated drug hypersensitivity."
