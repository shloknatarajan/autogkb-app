    "summary": "## Background\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether CYP2B6 genetic variation influences the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from the NNRTIs efavirenz (EFV) and nevirapine (NVP) in people living with HIV. Across the literature, several genes have been linked to antiretroviral-related DILI, with CYP2B6 emerging as a central pharmacogene. The CYP2B6*6 haplotype (defined by rs3745274 c.516G>T and rs2279343 c.785A>G) reduces CYP2B6 expression/activity and could alter NNRTI bioactivation and clearance.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Overall landscape: UGT1A1, CYP2B6, ABCB1, HLA-Cw, and HLA-DRB1 were most frequently reported with NNRTI-related hepatotoxicity; meta-analysis focused on CYP2B6.\n- Efavirenz-induced DILI (3 studies, all African cohorts; 106 cases/795 total):\n  - CYP2B6*6 carriers had higher DILI risk vs CYP2B6*1/*1:\n    - Heterozygous *1/*6: OR 1.83 (95% CI 1.15–2.90; p=0.01)\n    - Homozygous *6/*6: OR 2.48 (1.28–4.79; p=0.007)\n    - Combined carriers: OR 1.94 (1.24–3.01; p=0.003)\n  - Low heterogeneity; sensitivity analyses supported robustness.\n- Nevirapine-induced DILI (2 studies; African and Caucasian cohorts; 38 cases/820 total):\n  - CYP2B6*6 carriage was associated with lower DILI risk vs CYP2B6*1/*1:\n    - Heterozygous *1/*6: OR 0.44 (0.22–0.91; p=0.03)\n    - Homozygous *6/*6: OR 0.45 (0.15–1.32; p=0.14; not significant)\n    - Combined carriers: OR 0.42 (0.21–0.84; p=0.01)\n  - Low heterogeneity; results stable on sensitivity analyses.\n- Mechanistic context: Reduced CYP2B6 activity can increase EFV and 8‑OH‑EFV exposure (pro-hepatotoxic), but for NVP, multiple enzymes (notably CYP3A4) drive metabolite formation, which may explain the inverse association for *6.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Efavirenz: CYP2B6*6 identifies patients at roughly twofold higher DILI risk. If EFV is considered, genotype-guided care could include selecting alternative regimens, closer early liver function monitoring, and/or therapeutic drug monitoring where available.\n- Nevirapine: CYP2B6*6 may confer lower DILI risk, but evidence is limited (two studies) and homozygous effects were not statistically significant. Do not select NVP solely based on CYP2B6*6; consider other genetic (e.g., CYP3A4, HLA) and clinical risk factors.\n- Generalizability: EFV findings derive from African cohorts; NVP findings from African and Caucasian cohorts. Apply results cautiously across populations with different allele frequencies and co-medication patterns. Further multi-ethnic studies integrating additional metabolizing and immune genes are warranted."
