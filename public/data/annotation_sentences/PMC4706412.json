    "summary": "## Background\nWarfarin dose needs vary widely and existing pharmacogenetic (PGx) dosing tools were largely derived in Europeans, with limited applicability to admixed groups. This study developed and externally validated an admixture-adjusted, genotype-guided dose-refinement algorithm for Caribbean Hispanics (n=255 derivation; n=55 validation), using data available by day 3–4 of therapy.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Key variants and dose effects (per allele in the final model):\n  - VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231): 13% lower dose per A allele; GA p=0.007, AA p<0.0001; ~2.1% of dose variance explained in the refinement setting.\n  - CYP2C9 loss-of-function alleles: \n    - CYP2C9*2: lower dose (−7% in model; p=0.014).\n    - CYP2C9*3: lower dose (−16%; p=0.015).\n    - CYP2C9*8 (common in African ancestry): trend to lower dose (≈−31%; p=0.098). Rare African alleles (*5, *6, *11) were also present in this cohort.\n    - Combined CYP2C9 variants explained ~5% of dose variability; on average, ~18% dose reduction per loss-of-function allele.\n  - CYP4F2*3 (rs2108622): higher dose (+17%; p=0.014).\n  - NQO1*2 (rs1800566): trend toward higher dose (+10%; p=0.125).\n  - EPHX1 variants did not contribute to dosing in this model.\n  - A rare VKORC1 p.V45A (rs104894540) resistance variant and the VKORC1 H7 resistant haplotype were observed in a few patients.\n- Admixture/ancestry:\n  - An admixture index contributed a ~7% dose decrease for admixed status (p=0.108).\n  - Higher Amerindian ancestry was associated with greater likelihood of low-dose requirements (≤3 mg/day: 33% vs 19% in others; p<0.01).\n- Algorithm performance:\n  - Derivation cohort: R2=0.70; MAE=0.72 mg/day, outperforming a clinical-only model (R2=0.60; MAE=0.99 mg/day).\n  - External validation: R2≈0.58–0.59; MAE=0.89 mg/day, superior to two published PGx algorithms.\n  - In high-risk dose groups (≤3 mg or ≥7 mg/day), approximately half of predictions were within 20% of the actual dose vs ~29% with the clinical non-genetic model.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- For Caribbean Hispanics, PGx-guided warfarin dosing should include VKORC1 −1639G>A and comprehensive CYP2C9 genotyping that captures African-ancestry alleles (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11) to anticipate lower dose needs and minimize over-anticoagulation.\n- CYP4F2*3 supports higher dose requirements; NQO1*2 may increment dose modestly. EPHX1 testing adds little to dose refinement.\n- Considering individual ancestry/admixture improves dosing accuracy; higher Amerindian ancestry signals greater warfarin sensitivity (lower doses).\n- Applying this admixture-adjusted PGx refinement after 3–4 days (once initial INRs are available) improves dose precision, especially in low- and high-dose patients, and may reduce the risk of bleeding or thrombosis compared with clinical dosing alone."
