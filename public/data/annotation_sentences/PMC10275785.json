    "summary": "## Background\n- Study population: 100 Iraqi patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with infliximab or etanercept for 3 months, and 100 healthy controls.\n- Genes/SNPs examined: CARD8 rs2043211 (A>T) and NLRP3 rs4612666 (C>T), both involved in NLRP3 inflammasome regulation.\n- Outcomes: RA susceptibility, disease activity (DAS-28), serum TNF-α and IL-1β, and response to anti–TNF-α therapy.\n\n## Key Findings\n- No RA susceptibility signal: Genotype and allele frequencies for CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 did not differ significantly between patients and controls (P=0.17/0.059 and P=0.08/0.879, respectively).\n- Strong pharmacogenomic associations with anti–TNF-α response:\n  - CARD8 rs2043211:\n    - TT genotype associated with higher disease activity and cytokines: DAS-28 4.65±0.65; TNF-α 14.25±4.67 pg/mL; IL-1β 4.55±0.64 pg/mL (all P<0.0001 across genotypes).\n    - Markedly lower response rate: responders 1/16 (6%) for TT vs 32/37 (86%) for AA; genotype–response association P<0.0001.\n  - NLRP3 rs4612666:\n    - TT genotype associated with higher disease activity and cytokines: DAS-28 4.72±0.55; TNF-α 14.74±4.61 pg/mL; IL-1β 4.86±0.50 pg/mL (all P<0.0001 across genotypes).\n    - Markedly lower response rate: responders 1/11 (9%) for TT vs 41/47 (87%) for CC; genotype–response association P<0.0001.\n  - Genetic model analyses supported worse outcomes for T-allele–bearing genotypes at both loci (dominant/recessive models, P≤0.003), with strong odds ratios for non-response (e.g., CARD8 dominant model OR ~0.02; 95% CI ~0.002–0.16; NLRP3 models also significant).\n- Biomarker correlations: Higher TNF-α and IL-1β correlated with higher DAS-28 (r2=0.45 and 0.51; both P<0.0001) and with non-response (TNF-α 13.68 vs 4.83 pg/mL; IL-1β 3.36 vs 1.57 pg/mL; both P<0.0001).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- CARD8 rs2043211 and NLRP3 rs4612666 T-allele genotypes (especially TT) identify RA patients at high risk for poor response to infliximab or etanercept and for persistently high inflammatory activity.\n- These variants were not associated with RA risk in this cohort, but have potential as pharmacogenomic biomarkers to guide expectations for anti–TNF-α therapy and to consider early alternative/adjunctive strategies (e.g., switching mechanism, tighter monitoring).\n- Elevated baseline or on-treatment TNF-α/IL-1β levels align with poor response and may complement genotyping in predicting outcomes.\n- Practical note: Findings are from a single-center Iraqi cohort with modest sample size; validation in larger, diverse populations is needed before routine clinical implementation."
