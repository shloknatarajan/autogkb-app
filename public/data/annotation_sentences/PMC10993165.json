    "summary": "## Background\nSulfamethoxazole (SMX) and co‑trimoxazole (CTX; SMX/trimethoprim) are widely used antimicrobials but can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). This systematic review and meta‑analysis pooled 6 case‑control studies (322 SCAR cases; 8,448 healthy and 229 tolerant controls) to evaluate associations between HLA genotypes and SMX/CTX‑induced SCARs across Asian and European populations.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Overall SCAR risk (vs tolerant controls) was higher in carriers of:\n  - HLA-A*11:01 (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.11–4.00)\n  - HLA-B*13:01 (OR 5.96; 1.58–22.56)\n  - HLA-B*15:02 (OR 2.23; 1.20–4.14)\n  - HLA-B*38:02 (OR 3.47; 1.42–8.48)\n  - HLA-C*08:01 (OR 2.63; 1.07–6.44)\n\n- Phenotype-specific associations:\n  - SJS/TEN:\n    - HLA-B*15:02 (OR 3.01; 1.56–5.80 vs tolerant; OR 3.09; 1.90–5.02 vs healthy)\n    - HLA-B*38:02 (OR 5.13; 1.96–13.47 vs tolerant; OR 4.56; 2.65–7.85 vs healthy)\n    - Additional signals vs healthy: HLA-B*38:01 (OR 4.26; 1.43–12.71), HLA-B*13:01 (OR 2.49; 1.74–3.58), HLA-C*08:01 (OR 1.66; 1.13–2.44)\n  - DRESS:\n    - HLA-A*68:01 (OR 12.86; 1.09–151.34 vs tolerant; OR 7.03; 1.45–34.15 vs healthy)\n    - HLA-B*39:01 (OR 4.56; 1.31–15.82 vs tolerant; OR 3.70; 1.64–8.35 vs healthy)\n    - HLA-B*13:01 (very strong: OR 23.09; 3.31–161.00 vs tolerant; OR 23.93; 12.69–45.15 vs healthy)\n    - HLA-C*03:04 (OR 3.93; 2.71–5.69 vs healthy)\n\n- Population/subgroup patterns:\n  - Japanese: HLA-A*11:01 associated with SMX‑related SCARs (OR 9.84; 1.80–53.89 vs healthy).\n  - Europeans: HLA-B*38:01 and HLA-B*38:02 linked to SJS/TEN.\n  - Thai: HLA-A*11:01, HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*15:02, HLA-C*08:01 associated vs tolerant controls.\n  - Taiwanese: HLA-B*13:01, HLA-B*38:02 associated vs tolerant controls.\n  - HIV-positive patients on CTX showed amplified risks for several alleles, including HLA-C*08:01 (OR 7.85; 2.08–29.62) and HLA-C*07:27 (OR 28.38; 1.46–550.96) vs HIV‑positive tolerant controls.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Risk stratification: Carriage of HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-B*38:02 meaningfully increases SJS/TEN risk with SMX/CTX; HLA-B*13:01, HLA-A*68:01, and HLA-B*39:01 strongly mark DRESS risk. Consider targeted HLA testing in high-prevalence populations (e.g., Southeast/East Asia), in patients with HIV who commonly receive CTX, and in those with prior sulfonamide reactions.\n- Prescribing decisions: For carriers of high‑risk alleles—especially HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-B*38:02 (SJS/TEN) and HLA-B*13:01 or HLA-A*68:01 (DRESS)—weigh alternatives to SMX/CTX when suitable, or ensure intensive early monitoring and patient counseling if SMX/CTX is necessary.\n- Implementation: Given allele frequency and effect‑size variability across ancestries, integrate local population data and clinical context. While routine universal screening is not yet established, these data support selective pre‑emptive testing in high‑risk settings and heightened pharmacovigilance for early signs of SCARs. Further studies in diverse populations and with tolerant controls will refine testing strategies and clinical utility."
