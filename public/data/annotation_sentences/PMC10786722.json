    "summary": "## Background\nFluoropyrimidines (5‑fluorouracil/capecitabine) rely on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD; gene DPYD) for clearance. Reduced DPD activity increases drug exposure and risk of severe toxicity. In ~3,000 patients, the authors sequenced DPYD exons and splice junctions and measured pretreatment DPD activity using the plasma dihydrouracil/uracil (UH2/U) ratio to assess how common and rare variants relate to DPD deficiency.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Established high‑risk variants strongly associated with reduced DPD activity:\n  - c.1679T>G (DPYD*13; rs55886062), c.1905+1G>A (DPYD*2A; rs3918290), and c.2846A>T (rs67376798) were each linked to significantly lower UH2/U ratios (P < 0.001–0.0001), consistent with higher toxicity risk at standard dosing.\n- Several common variants showed modest associations with lower DPD activity:\n  - hapB3 tag c.1236G>A (rs56038477), c.496A>G (p.Met166Val; rs2297595), and DPYD*6 c.2194G>A (p.Val732Ile; rs1801160) were more frequent in partially deficient patients (P < 0.05–0.01), but effects were smaller than the established high‑risk variants.\n- Rare variants substantially contribute to low DPD activity:\n  - Variants with MAF <1% were enriched in patients with low DPD activity (9.3% vs 3.2%; P < 1×10^-5).\n  - This enrichment persisted after excluding the three established high‑risk variants (4.5% vs 2.6%; P < 0.03).\n  - Predicted deleterious rare variants (MAF <1%, CADD >15), excluding the three high‑risk variants, were also enriched (4.2% vs 1.6%; P < 0.001).\n  - Rare loss‑of‑function findings included frameshift DPYD*7 c.299_302del (rs539032572), splice‑site c.2766+1G>A, nonsense p.Trp650*, start‑loss c.1A>G, and other missense/splice variants detected largely in heterozygosity.\n\nNote: Clinical toxicity outcomes were not captured; associations are with DPD phenotype (UH2/U ratio), a validated surrogate of toxicity risk.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Preemptive DPYD testing should not be limited to the standard trio (DPYD*2A, *13, c.2846A>T) and hapB3. Comprehensive next‑generation sequencing that captures rare, potentially deleterious variants can improve identification of patients with reduced DPD activity and at risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity.\n- Use genotype‑guided dosing per current guidelines for known high‑risk alleles; consider dose reduction or alternative therapy when rare predicted loss‑of‑function variants are found, ideally corroborated by DPD phenotyping.\n- Combining comprehensive DPYD genotyping with phenotyping (when available) offers the most robust strategy to minimize fluoropyrimidine toxicity without compromising efficacy."
