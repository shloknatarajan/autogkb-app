    "summary": "## Background\nNevirapine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for HIV-1, can cause severe cutaneous rash and hepatotoxicity early after initiation. This multicenter, case–control study (276 cases; 587 matched controls; CD4 >150 cells/μl) evaluated 123 HLA alleles and 2744 SNPs in ADME and MHC genes across Black, Asian (predominantly Thai), and White populations to identify genetic predictors of these adverse events.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Cutaneous adverse events (rash):\n  - CYP2B6 516G>T (rs3745274): increased risk overall (OR 1.66). Risk rose with T-allele dose (trend p=0.0025 in Blacks; p=0.021 in Whites; weaker in Asians). Two linked CYP2B6 SNPs (rs2054675, rs3786547; r2≈0.98 with each other and >0.90 with 516G>T) were significant after multiple-testing correction.\n  - HLA-Cw*04: associated with rash across populations (OR 2.51 overall), most pronounced in Blacks and Asians.\n  - HLA-B*35: strong association in Asians (OR 3.47) and particularly Thais (OR 5.65); not significant in Blacks or Whites.\n  - Gene–gene combinations amplified risk: CYP2B6 516TT + HLA-Cw*04 (OR 6.31 overall; Blacks OR 18.90). In Asians, HLA-B*35 + HLA-Cw*04 conferred very high risk (OR 18.34; 95% CI 5.10–65.99).\n  - No association with HLA-Cw*08; weak HLA-Cw*15 in Whites did not persist for isolated rash.\n- Hepatic adverse events:\n  - HLA-DRB1*01 was associated in Whites (OR 3.02; increased to OR 3.63 when restricting to isolated hepatic events). HLA-DQB1*05 showed an association in Whites but likely due to linkage with DRB1*01 and was not significant for isolated hepatic events.\n  - No CYP2B6 or other ADME SNPs were associated with hepatic toxicity after multiple-testing correction; ABCB1 3435C>T was not significant (trend toward protection in Blacks, OR 0.50, p=0.27).\n- Population specificity: Effect sizes and detectability varied by ancestry, reflecting allele frequency differences.\n- Sensitivity limits: These markers missed many cases (e.g., 62% of rash cases lacked HLA-Cw*04; 80% of Asian rash cases lacked HLA-B*35; 56% of White hepatic cases lacked HLA-DRB1*01; 48% of all AE cases had none of HLA risk alleles nor CYP2B6 516TT).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Distinct mechanisms likely underlie nevirapine toxicity: cutaneous events appear MHC class I–mediated and influenced by CYP2B6-dependent metabolism; hepatic events appear MHC class II–mediated and not metabolism-dependent.\n- Routine pre-emptive genetic screening is not recommended due to low sensitivity and population specificity; negative tests do not reliably exclude risk.\n- Potential targeted use:\n  - In Asians (especially Thais), HLA-B*35 and HLA-Cw*04 identify higher rash risk; in Blacks, combined CYP2B6 516TT and HLA-Cw*04 indicates very high rash risk.\n  - In Whites, HLA-DRB1*01 flags increased hepatic risk.\n- Regardless of genotype, maintain close clinical and laboratory monitoring during the first 8 weeks of nevirapine therapy. CYP2B6 genotype–based dose changes are unlikely to mitigate hepatic toxicity. Consider alternative regimens for patients with high-risk genotypes in settings where testing is available and timely, coupled with shared decision-making."
