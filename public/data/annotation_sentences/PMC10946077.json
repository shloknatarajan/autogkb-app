    "summary": "## Background\nIrinotecan is an accepted second-line option for advanced gastric cancer but is limited by delayed diarrhea and myelosuppression. UGT1A1 glucuronidates the active metabolite SN-38; common variants UGT1A1*6 (more prevalent in East Asians) and UGT1A1*28 can affect toxicity risk. This single-center retrospective study (n=110 Chinese patients) used pre-treatment UGT1A1 genotyping to guide irinotecan dosing: GG (wild-type) 125 mg/m2; GA 100 mg/m2; AA 75 mg/m2, with paclitaxel substitution if severe toxicity occurred.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Toxicity:\n  - UGT1A1*6 was strongly associated with higher toxicity despite dose reduction: delayed diarrhea (p<0.001), neutropenia (p<0.001), and leukopenia (p=0.003) differed across GG/GA/AA. Grade 3/4 rates were markedly higher in AA than GG or GA; in the small AA subset receiving irinotecan, all experienced grade 3/4 diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia, versus GG 2%, 24%, 19% and GA 23%, 31%, 31%, respectively.\n  - UGT1A1*28 showed no significant association with diarrhea (p=0.136), neutropenia (p=0.991), or leukopenia (p=0.857). No genotype was associated with thrombocytopenia or hemoglobin decline.\n- Efficacy:\n  - With genotype-guided dosing and timely paclitaxel switch in intolerant AA patients, survival did not differ by genotype. Median PFS was similar across UGT1A1*6 genotypes (GG 4.8 mo; GA 4.9 mo; AA 4.4 mo; p=0.5249) and UGT1A1*28 genotypes; median OS likewise showed no differences (GG 9.3 mo; GA 9.3 mo; AA not reached; p=0.6821). UGT1A1*6 and *28 were not associated with PFS or OS in uni-/multivariable analyses (all p>0.28 for PFS; p>0.70 for OS).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Pre-treatment UGT1A1 testing—particularly UGT1A1*6—can guide safer irinotecan use in gastric cancer.\n  - GG: standard dose reasonable.\n  - GA: consider ~20% dose reduction with close monitoring for diarrhea and neutropenia.\n  - AA: high risk of severe hematologic/GI toxicity even with 40% dose reduction; irinotecan may be unsuitable—consider alternative therapy (e.g., paclitaxel).\n- In this East Asian cohort, UGT1A1*28 did not predict toxicity or outcomes and should not drive dosing decisions alone. Genotype-guided dosing maintained similar survival across genotypes while reducing severe toxicity in non-AA patients."
