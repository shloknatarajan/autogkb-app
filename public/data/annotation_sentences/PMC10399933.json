    "summary": "## Background\nThis real‑world cohort study linked genotypes from the Helsinki Biobank to prescription and laboratory data in 2042 incident statin users to evaluate whether common variants in SLCO1B1 (c.521T>C; rs4149056), ABCG2 (c.421C>A; rs2231142), and CYP2C9 (*2 rs1799853, *3 rs1057910) are associated with statin intolerance. Intolerance was defined primarily as switching from the index statin to another statin, and secondarily as switching with a temporally associated creatine kinase (CK) measurement (−30 to +90 days).\n\n## Key Findings\n- Simvastatin: SLCO1B1 c.521C/C (vs T/T) was associated with higher risk of intolerance by both definitions:\n  - Statin switching: HR 1.88 (95% CI 1.08–3.25; P=0.025)\n  - Switching + CK measurement: HR 5.44 (1.49–19.9; P=0.011)\n  - Higher simvastatin dose (≥40 mg) also increased switching risk: HR 1.48 (1.03–2.12; P=0.035).\n- Pravastatin: SLCO1B1 c.521T/C or C/C (vs T/T) increased switching risk: HR 2.11 (1.01–4.39; P=0.047). Note the modest sample size (n=92).\n- Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin: No significant associations between SLCO1B1 c.521T>C or ABCG2 c.421C>A and intolerance. Rosuvastatin 10 mg (vs 5 mg) was associated with more switching (HR 3.55; 1.07–11.8; P=0.038), reflecting dose rather than genotype.\n- Fluvastatin: No significant associations for SLCO1B1, ABCG2, or CYP2C9 phenotypes; a non‑significant trend with more combined risk alleles (HR 1.88; 0.90–3.96; P=0.094). CYP2C9 poor/intermediate metabolizers vs normal: HR 1.36 (0.67–2.78; P=0.394).\n- Overall, ABCG2 c.421C>A and CYP2C9*2/*3 were not significantly associated with intolerance for atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin in this dataset.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- The findings reinforce CPIC guidance: SLCO1B1 c.521T>C (especially C/C) confers increased risk of simvastatin intolerance; consider lower simvastatin doses, alternative statins, or closer monitoring.\n- New signal for pravastatin: SLCO1B1 c.521T>C carriers may also have higher intolerance risk to pravastatin at 20–40 mg; consider atorvastatin or rosuvastatin (at typical doses) as alternatives in carriers, recognizing that this study did not find genotype–intolerance links for those agents.\n- ABCG2 c.421C>A and CYP2C9*2/*3 offered limited predictive value for intolerance in this real‑world cohort.\n- Using statin switching (± CK) as a pragmatic intolerance phenotype is feasible; larger studies may refine statin‑specific genotype recommendations and dose thresholds."
