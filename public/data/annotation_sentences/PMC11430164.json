    "summary": "## Background\nTicagrelor is primarily cleared by CYP3A4. Higher ticagrelor plasma concentrations correlate with bleeding and dyspnea, while the active metabolite (AR‑C124910XX) is less linked to these adverse effects. This in vitro study characterized ticagrelor metabolism by 22 CYP3A4 protein variants identified in the Chinese Han population using recombinant enzymes, quantifying intrinsic clearance (CLint = Vmax/Km) via AR‑C124910XX formation.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Broad allele-specific effects on ticagrelor clearance were observed versus wild‑type CYP3A4*1; most differences were statistically significant (generally p<0.01).\n- Increased metabolic activity (higher CLint):\n  - CYP3A4*11 (T363M): 264.7% of wild-type\n  - CYP3A4*18 (L293P): 122.5%\n  - CYP3A4*33 (A370S): 117.8%\n- Similar to wild‑type:\n  - CYP3A4*10 (111.4%), *23 (92.8%), *32 (103.8%), *34 (111.9%)\n- Decreased metabolic activity:\n  - Markedly reduced: CYP3A4*24 (Q200H) 1.48%; CYP3A4*17 (F189S) 4.72%\n  - Moderately to substantially reduced (25–75% of wild-type): CYP3A4*2 (25.5%), *3 (35.0%), *4 (68.8%), *5 (46.3%), *9 (75.0%), *14 (28.7%), *15 (71.8%), *16 (45.1%), *19 (67.4%), *28 (53.3%), *29 (66.5%), *31 (75.1%)\n- No measurable activity:\n  - CYP3A4*30 (R130STOP): null/near-null activity toward ticagrelor.\n- Contextual clinical evidence (not part of the enzyme panel but relevant): CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367) reduces hepatic CYP3A4 expression and is associated with higher ticagrelor exposure (≈+89% AUC) and increased bleeding risk in clinical studies.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Reduced-function or null CYP3A4 alleles (especially *24, *17, and others listed) may slow ticagrelor clearance, potentially increasing plasma levels and elevating bleeding and dyspnea risk at standard doses. Increased-function alleles (*11, *18, *33) may lower exposure, possibly risking reduced effect in some patients.\n- Because adverse events correlate with ticagrelor (parent) concentration, consider closer monitoring for toxicity in carriers of decreased-function alleles and assess antiplatelet effect in carriers of increased-function alleles. Therapeutic drug monitoring of ticagrelor and vigilance for CYP3A inhibitors/inducers are advisable.\n- These results are from in vitro recombinant systems; they support hypothesis generation for genotype-informed risk assessment. Clinical pharmacokinetic studies are needed to define dosing adjustments. Existing clinical data for CYP3A4*22 already demonstrate that reduced CYP3A4 function can meaningfully raise ticagrelor exposure and bleeding risk."
