    "summary": "## Background\nThiopurines (azathioprine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine) are effective immunosuppressants/antineoplastics but can cause life-threatening toxicity. This case report describes a South Asian woman who developed profound pancytopenia, hepatotoxicity, and severe alopecia shortly after starting mercaptopurine; genotyping showed NUDT15 loss-of-function (LOF) homozygosity (*3/*3) with wild-type TPMT.\n\n## Key Findings\n- NUDT15 variant and toxicity:\n  - NUDT15*3 (c.415C>T; R139C) is a LOF allele that impairs detoxification of active thioguanine nucleotides, leading to accumulation and toxicity. Individuals homozygous for NUDT15*3 tolerate about 8% of the standard mercaptopurine dose before significant toxicity, similar to TPMT poor metabolizers.\n  - Early, severe alopecia can be an early signal of thiopurine toxicity and may precede myelosuppression; it is strongly associated with NUDT15 R139C but can occur even without NUDT15 variants.\n- Population differences:\n  - NUDT15 LOF alleles are more common in Asians and Hispanics: roughly 21% carry one LOF allele and about 2% carry two, compared with ~10% and 0.3% for TPMT LOF in Europeans/Africans, respectively.\n- TPMT variants and toxicity:\n  - TPMT LOF variants (*2, *3A, *3C; plus *3B) explain >90–95% of reduced TPMT activity. Poor metabolizers (two LOF alleles) almost universally develop severe thiopurine toxicity even at 10-fold dose reductions.\n  - In an RCT of IBD patients, pretreatment TPMT testing with genotype-guided dose reduction decreased hematologic adverse events by ~10-fold in at-risk individuals.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Genotype both NUDT15 and TPMT before initiating thiopurines, particularly in Asian and Hispanic patients and across specialties that use these drugs. Current practice often emphasizes TPMT; adding NUDT15 testing increases yield and safety.\n- For NUDT15 poor metabolizers (e.g., NUDT15*3/*3), avoid thiopurines or consider drastic dose minimization with intensive monitoring; many patients may still experience severe toxicity despite large dose reductions.\n- Recognize sudden alopecia as a potential early warning of thiopurine toxicity; promptly suspend therapy and assess with pharmacogenetic testing.\n- Broader adoption of dual-gene (TPMT+NUDT15) guidance—already standard in pediatric ALL and in several Asian guidelines—could reduce serious adverse drug reactions and transfusion/ hospitalization burden."
