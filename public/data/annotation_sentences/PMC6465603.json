    "summary": "## Background\nAzathioprine (AZA) is widely used for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and AIH–primary biliary cholangitis overlap, but leukopenia is a major toxicity. In East Asians, TPMT variants are uncommon and poorly predict thiopurine toxicity. This retrospective study (n=149 Chinese AIH/AIH–PBC patients on AZA) evaluated NUDT15 rs116855232 (p.R139C) and TPMT*3C rs1142345 as predictors of AZA-induced leukopenia and dose requirements.\n\n## Key Findings\n- NUDT15 rs116855232 T allele strongly predicted AZA-induced leukopenia: OR 20.41 (95% CI 7.84–53.13), P<0.00001; sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 89.1%. Leukopenia occurred in 37.5% of CT and 100% of TT vs 0.8% of CC; all cases arose within 60 days of starting or increasing AZA.\n- NUDT15 genotype influenced thiopurine exposure and dosing: heterozygotes (CT) had higher 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) levels (median 276.6 vs 145.3 pmol/8×10^8 RBC; P=0.002) and required lower maintenance AZA doses (median 0.96 vs 1.23 mg/kg/day; P=0.028). The dose-to-6-TGN ratio was significantly lower in CT carriers.\n- TPMT*3C rs1142345 showed no significant association with leukopenia or AZA dose; the variant was rare (~1.7%).\n- Overall 6-TGN levels did not distinguish patients with vs without leukopenia (P=0.149). In 13 patients with pre-therapy leukopenia, WBC counts did not worsen on AZA; one was NUDT15 CT without progression.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Genotype NUDT15 (in addition to TPMT) before thiopurine therapy in AIH, particularly in East Asian populations. NUDT15 is a strong predictor of early leukopenia and dose tolerance.\n- For NUDT15 CT (intermediate metabolizers): start AZA at a lower dose (~0.8–1.0 mg/kg/day), monitor CBCs closely during the first 8 weeks, and titrate cautiously; expect higher 6-TGN at a given dose.\n- For NUDT15 TT (poor metabolizers): avoid or use very low AZA doses with intensive monitoring; consider alternatives (e.g., mycophenolate) due to risk of severe myelosuppression.\n- Baseline leukopenia or cirrhosis may not contraindicate AZA if NUDT15 is wild-type, but vigilant monitoring remains essential. Limitations include single-center design and testing only common variants."
