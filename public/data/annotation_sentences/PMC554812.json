    "summary": "## Background\nAllopurinol is widely used for gout and hyperuricemia but can cause rare, life‑threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) including hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). This case–control study in Han Chinese (Taiwan) evaluated genetic markers of risk by genotyping HLA loci and 823 SNPs in drug metabolism and immune pathways among 51 allopurinol–SCAR cases, 135 allopurinol‑tolerant controls, and 93 population controls.\n\n## Key Findings\n- The strongest association was with HLA-B*58:01: present in 100% (51/51) of SCAR cases vs 15% (20/135) of tolerant controls [odds ratio (OR) 580.3; 95% CI 34.4–9780.9; corrected P = 4.7 × 10^–24] and 20% (19/93) of population controls (OR 393.5; 95% CI 23.2–6665.3; corrected P = 8.1 × 10^–18). This suggests HLA-B*58:01 is a necessary, though not sufficient, risk factor in this population (some tolerant carriers exist).\n- Additional HLA alleles were enriched due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B*58:01: HLA-A*33:03 (OR 9.3; Pc = 2.2 × 10^–4), HLA-C*03:02 (Cw*0302; OR 97.7; Pc = 1.4 × 10^–19), and HLA-DRB1*03:01 (OR 12.7; Pc = 2.8 × 10^–6). An extended haplotype A*33:03–C*03:02–B*58:01–DRB1*03:01 was present in 41% of cases vs 7–10% of controls.\n- SNP screening reinforced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involvement, with very strong signals in MHC class III (BAT3 rs3117583, MSH5 rs1150793, MICB rs2855804; P < 10^–7). Outside the MHC, two CFLAR variants (rs2268791, rs1594) showed association (P < 0.01) and were supported on replication; a KIR2DL1 SNP (rs2304224) did not replicate.\n- Chronic renal insufficiency was more frequent in cases and associated with higher SCAR risk (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.3–9.3), highlighting a clinical cofactor alongside genetic susceptibility.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Pre-prescription HLA-B*58:01 testing can identify Han Chinese patients at extremely high risk for allopurinol‑induced SCAR. In this study, absence of HLA-B*58:01 effectively ruled out SCAR among cases; presence confers very high relative risk but not absolute certainty.\n- For HLA-B*58:01 carriers—especially those with chronic kidney disease—consider avoiding allopurinol and using alternative urate‑lowering therapies. Genotyping may offer better risk mitigation than dose adjustment alone.\n- While the primary evidence is in Han Chinese, HLA-B*58:01 occurs in other populations; applicability should be considered with local allele frequencies and validated data."
