    "summary": "## Background\nThiopurines (especially 6‑mercaptopurine, 6‑MP) are key drugs in maintenance therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Variants in TPMT and NUDT15 are established predictors of thiopurine intolerance in many populations. This single-center longitudinal study in Colombia genotyped pediatric ALL patients during the first 6 months of maintenance to test whether common TPMT and NUDT15 variants correlate with myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and 6‑MP dose modification.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Cohort: 70 children (68 successfully genotyped). Outcomes observed overall: myelotoxicity 25%, hepatotoxicity 27%, 6‑MP dose reduction 32.9%, interruption 28.6%.\n- Variants tested: NUDT15 rs116855232; TPMT rs1800462 (TPMT*2), rs1800460 and rs1142345 (used to derive TPMT haplotypes). No homozygous variant carriers were detected; all variant carriers were heterozygous.\n  - Carrier frequencies: NUDT15 rs116855232 C/T 4/68 (5.9%); TPMT rs1800462 4/68 (5.9%); rs1800460 6/68 (8.8%); rs1142345 4/42 (9.5% of those typed). TPMT diplotypes (n=42): *1/*1 (n=36), *1/*2 (n=2), *1/*3A (n=4).\n- Association analyses:\n  - No statistically significant associations between NUDT15 rs116855232 or individual TPMT SNPs and any outcome (all p>0.05).\n  - TPMT diplotype analyses likewise showed no significant links: 6‑MP reduction (p=0.616), interruption (p=0.308), neutropenia (p=1.000), relapse (p=0.557), death (p=1.000).\n- Descriptive trends (not statistically significant): 2/4 NUDT15 heterozygotes required 6‑MP dose decreases; 2/4 TPMT rs1800462 heterozygotes had febrile neutropenia and required 6‑MP discontinuation; 3/6 rs1800460 heterozygotes required dose decreases.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- In this Colombian pediatric cohort, common TPMT and NUDT15 variants did not significantly predict early 6‑MP toxicity or dose modification, likely reflecting low variant frequencies, absence of homozygous poor metabolizers, and limited sample size.\n- Clinicians should continue close clinical and laboratory monitoring for thiopurine toxicity, as genotype-negative patients can still experience adverse effects.\n- Despite the null associations here, broader evidence supports CPIC-guided thiopurine dosing using TPMT and NUDT15 genotypes; preemptive testing may still be considered, with the understanding that predictive value may vary in admixed Latin American populations.\n- Larger, multicenter Latin American studies incorporating comprehensive TPMT/NUDT15 variant panels and ancestry-informed analyses are needed to refine dosing guidance for this region."
