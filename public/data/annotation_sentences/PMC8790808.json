    "summary": "## Background\nPegaspargase is essential in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy, but hypersensitivity reactions limit its use. This multi-cohort, ancestrally diverse study (n ≈ 3,900) conducted HLA-focused and genome-wide association analyses to identify germline variants that predispose to pegaspargase hypersensitivity, examining European ancestry (EA) and non-EA groups separately.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Class II HLA haplotype in EAs:\n  - The HLA-DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype was strongly associated with hypersensitivity. The single strongest allele was HLA-DQB1*02:02 (Pmeta = 3.8×10−9; OR ≈ 2.13), with HLA-DRB1*07:01 (Pmeta = 2.2×10−5; OR ≈ 1.96) and HLA-DQA1*02:01 (Pmeta = 2.7×10−5; OR ≈ 1.96) also significant. HLA-DRB1*04:02 showed a rarer but larger effect (Pmeta = 6.3×10−5; OR ≈ 4.61).\n  - Risk from HLA-DRB1*07:01 depended on co-carriage of DQB1*02:02 (with DQB1*02:02: P = 2.0×10−7; without: P = 0.45), highlighting DQB1*02:02 as the key driver.\n  - GWAS in EAs pinpointed class II HLA SNPs tagging this haplotype, including rs1694129 (5′ of HLA-DQB1; Pmeta = 1.1×10−8; OR ≈ 2.03; r2 = 0.96 with DQB1*02:02) and rs28383308 (5′ of HLA-DQA1; Pmeta = 4.9×10−14; OR ≈ 1.95).\n  - Tagging SNPs rs28383172 and rs7775228 also marked the risk haplotype and were associated with reactions in EAs (Pmeta = 2.9×10−4 and 3.9×10−5).\n\n- Non-EA patients:\n  - Novel non-HLA signals reached genome-wide significance: rs9958628 in the 5′-UTR of ARHGAP28 (Pmeta = 8.9×10−9; OR ≈ 3.69), the top non-HLA hit overall (Pmeta = 1.2×10−7; OR ≈ 3.03) and significant within African ancestry meta-analysis (Pmeta = 3.2×10−5; OR ≈ 2.03).\n  - Two additional non-HLA variants near GPBP1 (rs79377225 and rs11739459) were significant in non-EAs (Pmeta = 2.5×10−8; OR ≈ 2.70 and Pmeta = 2.7×10−8; OR ≈ 2.50) and remained significant in trans-ancestry meta-analyses.\n  - HLA associations in non-EAs were weaker and less consistent; imputed DRB1*07:01, DQA1*02:01, and DQB1*02:02 showed nominal associations only, and the top EA-tagging SNP rs1694129 replicated nominally (Pmeta = 0.013; OR ≈ 2.01).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- In children of European ancestry, carriage of the DRB1*07:01–DQA1*02:01–DQB1*02:02 haplotype—especially DQB1*02:02—confers approximately a twofold increased risk of pegaspargase hypersensitivity. Readily genotyped tag SNPs (e.g., rs1694129, rs28383308) may serve as surrogates in EAs.\n- In non-EA patients, additional risk appears driven by non-HLA loci (ARHGAP28 and GPBP1), suggesting ancestry-specific biology. Given imputation limitations and variable replication across ancestries, routine clinical genotyping is not yet recommended.\n- Short-term application could include heightened monitoring and early consideration of switching asparaginase formulations in genetically high-risk patients. Further validation with high-resolution HLA typing across ancestries and functional studies of ARHGAP28/GPBP1 are warranted before implementing broad preemptive testing."
