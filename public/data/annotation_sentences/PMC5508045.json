    "summary": "## Background\nThis retrospective study examined how genetic and non-genetic factors influence stable warfarin dose requirements in 250 Thai patients. Genotyping focused on VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829.\n\n## Key Findings\n- VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231): Strongest genetic predictor. Compared with GG, GA and AA genotypes required 27.7% and 49.7% lower weekly doses, respectively (p<0.001). In multivariable modeling, GA and AA were associated with −9.7 mg/week and −18.1 mg/week, respectively (both p<0.001), accounting for 26.2% of dose variability.\n- CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910): Variant carriers needed less warfarin. Versus *1/*1, doses were 34.1% lower for *1/*3 and 64.6% lower for *3/*3 (p=0.006). In multivariable analysis, effects were −7.9 mg/week for *1/*3 and −25.9 mg/week for *3/*3 (both p<0.001), contributing 6.0% to variability.\n- CYP4F2 rs2108622: Small, positive effect on dose. While univariate differences were not significant (p=0.172), multivariable analysis showed TT genotype required +4.1 mg/week versus CC (p=0.016), explaining 1.2% of variability.\n- UGT1A1 rs887829: No association with dose (p=0.921).\n- Overall model including VKORC1, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2, and clinical covariates (age, BMI, amiodarone, antiplatelets, smoking) explained 51.3% of interindividual dose variability.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- For Thai patients, genotype-guided dosing should prioritize VKORC1 −1639G>A and CYP2C9*3, with CYP4F2 rs2108622 considered as a minor modifier; UGT1A1 rs887829 need not be included for warfarin dose prediction.\n- Expect substantially lower initial and maintenance doses in VKORC1 A-allele carriers and CYP2C9*3 carriers; conversely, consider modest upward adjustment for CYP4F2 TT.\n- Incorporating these variants alongside age, BMI, and key drug interactions (amiodarone, antiplatelets, smoking) can markedly improve dose prediction, potentially reducing time to stable anticoagulation and minimizing adverse events."
