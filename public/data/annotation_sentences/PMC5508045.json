    "summary": "## Background\nThis retrospective study of 250 Thai patients on stable warfarin examined how genetic and non-genetic factors influence maintenance dose. Genotyping targeted VKORC1 −1639G>A (rs9923231), CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910), CYP4F2 rs2108622, and UGT1A1 rs887829.\n\n## Key Findings\n- VKORC1 −1639G>A was the strongest genetic predictor of dose. Compared with GG, GA and AA genotypes required ~27.7% and ~49.7% lower weekly doses, respectively (p < 0.001). In multivariable modeling, GA and AA were associated with −9.7 mg and −18.1 mg/week, respectively (both p < 0.001), explaining 26.2% of dose variance.\n- CYP2C9*3 carriers required lower doses. Versus *1/*1, *1/*3 and *3/*3 had ~34.1% and ~64.6% lower doses (p = 0.006). In multivariable analysis, effects were −7.9 mg (*1/*3) and −25.9 mg (*3/*3) per week (both p < 0.001), contributing 6.0% of variance.\n- CYP4F2 rs2108622 had a modest effect: the TT genotype increased dose by +4.1 mg/week vs CC (p = 0.016), accounting for 1.2% of variance. (Univariate differences were not significant.)\n- UGT1A1 rs887829 showed no association with dose (p = 0.921).\n- A combined model including VKORC1, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2, and clinical factors (age, BMI, antiplatelet use, amiodarone use, current smoking) explained 51.3% of dose variability. Notably, age reduced dose by 0.25 mg/year (p < 0.001) and BMI increased dose by 0.345 mg per kg/m2 (p < 0.001); amiodarone (−7.2 mg/week) and antiplatelets (−3.4 mg/week) lowered dose, while current smoking increased dose (+4.0 mg/week).\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- For Thai patients, VKORC1 −1639G>A and CYP2C9*3 are the primary pharmacogenetic determinants of warfarin dose and should be prioritized for genotyping to guide initial dosing and maintenance adjustments; carriers of VKORC1 A and/or CYP2C9*3 generally need substantially lower doses.\n- CYP4F2 rs2108622 (TT) provides additional, modest upward adjustment; UGT1A1 rs887829 testing does not appear useful for warfarin dosing in this population.\n- Incorporating these variants alongside age, BMI, and key co-medications (amiodarone, antiplatelets) and smoking status can materially improve dose prediction and may reduce time to stable anticoagulation and adverse events."
