    "summary": "## Background\nThis preliminary study evaluated whether common pharmacogenetic variants influence escitalopram pharmacokinetics and adverse effects in 66 adolescents (12–17 years) with depression and/or anxiety who have a first-degree relative with bipolar I disorder. Genotyping focused on CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (drug metabolism), and HTR2A rs6311 and SLC6A4 (serotonin pathway). Forty-eight participants contributed pharmacokinetic (PK) data.\n\n## Key Findings\n- CYP2C19 and escitalopram exposure:\n  - Slower CYP2C19 metabolizers had higher dose-normalized exposure and slower clearance: increased AUC0–24 (p = 0.025), higher trough concentrations (p = 0.013), and longer half-life (p < 0.001); Cmax trended higher (p = 0.057).\n  - CYP2C19 phenotype was not associated with clinician- or caregiver-reported adverse events (hyperarousal, PAERS, TEASAP subscales).\n\n- CYP2D6 and adverse events:\n  - CYP2D6 phenotype did not affect escitalopram PK.\n  - Slower CYP2D6 metabolizers showed greater activation-type adverse symptoms:\n    - Higher TEASAP akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety scores (p = 0.015).\n    - In aggregate analyses, higher disinhibition/impulsivity (mean 3.0 vs 1.1; p = 0.02), with trends toward higher mania (p = 0.07) and akathisia/hyperkinesis/somatic anxiety (p = 0.08).\n  - No association with hyperarousal events or PAERS maxima.\n\n- HTR2A rs6311 (−1438G>A) and risk behaviors:\n  - Carriers of the A allele (A/A or A/G) had greater increases in TEASAP “self-injury, suicidality, and harm to others” vs G/G (p = 0.017). No differences on other subscales, PAERS, or hyperarousal.\n\n- SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR):\n  - No associations with adverse events in this cohort.\n\n- Escitalopram exposure vs adverse events:\n  - Non–dose-normalized Cmax and AUC0–24 were not significantly associated with hyperarousal or TEASAP changes.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Dose optimization:\n  - Findings support existing CPIC guidance that CYP2C19 phenotype influences escitalopram exposure; consider CYP2C19-guided dosing to achieve target concentrations in youth.\n  - CYP2D6 does not appear to influence escitalopram PK; no dosing changes are supported by these data.\n\n- Safety monitoring:\n  - Slower CYP2D6 metabolizers may have higher risk of activation-like adverse effects (akathisia, disinhibition/impulsivity). Consider closer monitoring for restlessness, motor agitation, and behavioral disinhibition after initiation and dose increases.\n  - HTR2A rs6311 A-allele carriers may be at increased risk for self-harm/suicidality-related behaviors; ensure enhanced safety surveillance and counseling in high-risk youth starting escitalopram.\n\n- Implementation caveats:\n  - Results are hypothesis-generating (small sample; few poor metabolizers; no correction for multiple comparisons) and conducted in youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder, which may limit generalizability.\n  - Current evidence continues to support CYP2C19-guided dosing for SSRIs; routine therapy changes based solely on CYP2D6 or HTR2A genotypes are not yet recommended, but these markers may inform risk stratification and monitoring plans. Larger studies are needed to confirm these associations."
