    "summary": "## Background\nThis cohort study (n=542 Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia) evaluated whether two common SLCO1B1 variants—rs2306283 (388A>G) and rs4149056 (521T>C)—influence baseline hepatic enzymes/lipids and the lipid-lowering response to simvastatin. Participants received simvastatin 20 mg nightly for 8 weeks; lipids and liver enzymes were measured at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks.\n\n## Key Findings\n- Baseline hepatic enzymes:\n  - rs2306283: 388AA was associated with higher ALT and AST versus AG/GG (adjusted P=0.037 and P=0.002, respectively). Patients with 388AA plus 521TT had the highest ALT/AST (adjusted P=0.001 for both).\n  - Odds of elevated enzymes (≥40 U/L) were lower in 388G carriers: ALT OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2–0.9); AST OR 0.5 (0.2–1.0).\n  - Haplotype analysis: Abnormal ALT/AST groups had higher 388A/521T and lower 388G/521T frequencies (ALT P=0.038 and 0.040; AST P=0.007 and 0.032).\n- Baseline lipids:\n  - 388AA was associated with slightly higher HDL-C than AG/GG (adjusted P=0.049). No baseline lipid associations for 521T>C.\n- Simvastatin response:\n  - At 4 weeks, among 388G carriers, rs4149056 C-allele carriers (TC/CC; includes SLCO1B1*5 and the low-activity haplotype *15 [388G/521C]) had smaller reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol versus 521TT. Conversely, 388G with 521TT showed significantly greater LDL-C and total cholesterol reductions (Supplemental Table 3).\n  - By 8 weeks, genotype-based differences in lipid lowering were no longer significant.\n- Safety:\n  - Creatine kinase rose overall with treatment, but no association with rs2306283 or rs4149056 was detected in this cohort.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- Early simvastatin response (first month) may be attenuated in rs4149056 C-allele carriers, particularly the SLCO1B1*15 haplotype (388G/521C). In such patients, consider closer early lipid monitoring, dose optimization, or alternative statins less dependent on OATP1B1.\n- Patients with 388AA (especially combined with 521TT) showed higher baseline ALT/AST and enriched 388A/521T haplotype in abnormal enzyme groups, suggesting value in heightened liver enzyme monitoring in these genotypes.\n- These findings are most applicable to Chinese patients on simvastatin 20 mg and mainly predict early (4-week) lipid response; replication and longer-term data are needed before routine genotype-guided changes to therapy duration or choice."
