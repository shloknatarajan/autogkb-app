    "summary": "## Background\nClopidogrel is a prodrug activated primarily by CYP2C19. Loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) CYP2C19 variants can alter antiplatelet effect and clinical outcomes. This prospective cohort of 50 Syrian patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI examined CYP2C19*2 (LOF), *3 (LOF), and *17 (GOF) variants and their association with clinical outcomes while on a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day) as part of DAPT, with 18–24 months follow-up (outcomes available for n=41).\n\n## Key Findings\n- Variant frequencies: CYP2C19*2 = 8%, CYP2C19*3 = 0%, CYP2C19*17 = 17%. Phenotypes: normal metabolizer 56%, intermediate 12%, rapid 26%, ultrarapid 4%, poor 2%.\n- No association between CYP2C19*2 carrier status and recurrent ischemic events (MACE) on doubled-dose clopidogrel (1/6 vs 1/35; P=0.2744). Refractory angina symptoms also did not differ by CYP2C19*2 status (P>0.9999).\n- Bleeding events were numerically higher in CYP2C19*17 carriers versus non-carriers (16.7% vs 6.9%) but not statistically significant (P=0.567). Bleeding was also numerically higher in CYP2C19*2 carriers (33.3% vs 5.7%; P=0.0952) but not significant.\n- CYP2C19*3 carriers were absent, so associations could not be assessed.\n\n## Clinical Implications\n- In this Syrian cohort, a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day) appeared to mitigate the expected adverse ischemic impact of CYP2C19 LOF carriage, with no observed increase in MACE among CYP2C19*2 carriers. The study did not detect a significant increase in bleeding among CYP2C19*17 carriers on this regimen.\n- Given the small sample size and limited events, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. They suggest that dose escalation may be a pragmatic option where alternative P2Y12 inhibitors are not feasible, but current guidelines generally favor prasugrel or ticagrelor over clopidogrel for IM/PM phenotypes after PCI. Local CYP2C19 allele frequencies (notably low *3 and moderate *2 and *17) can inform regional implementation of pharmacogenomic testing and antiplatelet selection, pending confirmation in larger studies with platelet function and/or active metabolite measurements."
