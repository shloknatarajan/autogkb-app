            "content": "The study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms in the organic cation transporters OCT1 and OCT2 on the uptake of ranitidine, a common H2-receptor antagonist. Using HEK293 and CHO cells overexpressing various OCT1 and OCT2 alleles, the researchers found that ranitidine is a substrate of OCT1, with significant variability in uptake due to common OCT1 polymorphisms, while OCT2 showed limited ranitidine uptake unaffected by its Ala270Ser polymorphism. The findings suggest that OCT1 genetic variations can significantly impact ranitidine uptake and its potential for drug-drug interactions.",

In contrast, the OCT1*8 allele showed a 25% increase in vmax, though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.5). The study also found that ranitidine inhibited OCT1-mediated uptake of metformin and morphine at clinically relevant concentrations, with the inhibitory potency for morphine uptake being affected by the OCT1*2 allele. OCT2 showed limited uptake of ranitidine, which was not significantly affected by the Ala270Ser polymorphism. The findings suggest that poor OCT1 transporters may have increased plasma concentrations of ranitidine, but this is not expected to have clinical consequences due to ranitidine's broad therapeutic range.",
