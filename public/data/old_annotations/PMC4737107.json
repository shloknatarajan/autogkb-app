The researchers found that TPMT heterozygotes required more frequent dose adjustments due to cytopenias compared to wild-type patients, yet TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had better event-free survival (EFS) than wild-type patients. The study concluded that thiopurine-induced cytopenias did not negatively affect treatment outcomes, and TPMT*1/*3A heterozygotes had a superior EFS compared to TPMT*1/*1 patients.",
